3.1.0
-----

* Add support for Azure Key Service

3.0.5
-----

3.0.3
----

* --set now works with nested data structures and not just simple
  values

* Changed default log level to warn instead of info

* Avoid creating empty files when using the editor mode to create new
  files and not making any changes to the example files

* Output unformatted strings when using --extract instead of encoding
  them to yaml

* Allow forcing binary input and output types from command line flags

* Deprecate filename_regex in favor of path_regex. filename_regex had
  a bug and matched on the whole file path, when it should have only
  matched on the file name. path_regex on the other hand is documented
  to match on the whole file path.

* Add an encrypted-suffix option, the exact opposite of
  unencrypted-suffix

* Allow specifying unencrypted_suffix and encrypted_suffix rules in
  the .sops.yaml configuration file

* Introduce key service flag optionally prompting users on
  encryption/decryption

* some improvements to error messages

3.0.0
-----

* Shamir secret sharing scheme support allows SOPS to require multiple master
  keys to access a data key and decrypt a file. See `sops groups -help` and the
  documentation in README.

* Keyservice to forward access to a local master key on a socket, similar to
  gpg-agent. See `sops keyservice --help` and the documentation in README.

* Encrypt comments by default

* Support for Google Compute Platform KMS

* Refactor of the store logic to separate the internal representation SOPS
  has of files from the external representation used in JSON and YAML files

* Reencoding of versions as string on sops 1.X files.
  **WARNING** this change breaks backward compatibility.
  SOPS shows an error message with instructions on how to solve
  this if it happens.
  
* Added command to reconfigure the keys used to encrypt/decrypt a file based on the .sops.yaml config file

* Retrieve missing PGP keys from gpg.mozilla.org
