A single\n`Action` represents a repeatable action that can be performed by the\nexecution service. `Action`s can be succinctly identified by the digest of\ntheir wire format encoding and, once an `Action` has been executed, will be\ncached in the action cache. Future requests can then use the cached result\nrather than needing to run afresh.\n\nWhen a server completes execution of an\nAction, it MAY choose to\ncache the result in\nthe ActionCache unless\n`do_not_cache` is `true`. Clients SHOULD expect the server to do so. By\ndefault, future calls to\nExecute the same\n`Action` will also serve their results from the cache. Clients must take care\nto understand the caching behaviour. Ideally, all `Action`s will be\nreproducible so that serving a result from cache is always desirable and\ncorrect.",

This is because, if they were not, running an\n`Action` with a lower timeout than is required might result in a cache hit\nfrom an execution run with a longer timeout, hiding the fact that the\ntimeout is too short.

That is, even if the `hash` field is correctly specified but\n`size_bytes` is not, the server MUST reject the request.\n\nThe reason for including the size in the digest is as follows: in a great\nmany cases, the server needs to know the size of the blob it is about to work\nwith prior to starting an operation with it, such as flattening Merkle tree\nstructures or streaming it to a worker. Technically, the server could\nimplement a separate metadata store, but this results in a significantly more\ncomplicated implementation as opposed to having the client specify the size\nup-front (or storing the size along with the digest in every message where\ndigests are embedded). This does mean that the API leaks some implementation\ndetails of (what we consider to be) a reasonable server implementation, but\nwe consider this to be a worthwhile tradeoff.\n\nWhen a `Digest` is used to refer to a proto message, it always refers to the\nmessage in binary encoded form. To ensure consistent hashing, clients and\nservers MUST ensure that they serialize messages according to the following\nrules, even if there are alternate valid encodings for the same message:\n\n* Fields are serialized in tag order.\n* There are no unknown fields.\n* There are no duplicate fields.\n* Fields are serialized according to the default semantics for their type.\n\nMost protocol buffer implementations will always follow these rules when\nserializing, but care should be taken to avoid shortcuts.

That is, even if the `hash` field is correctly specified but\n`size_bytes` is not, the server MUST reject the request.\n\nThe reason for including the size in the digest is as follows: in a great\nmany cases, the server needs to know the size of the blob it is about to work\nwith prior to starting an operation with it, such as flattening Merkle tree\nstructures or streaming it to a worker. Technically, the server could\nimplement a separate metadata store, but this results in a significantly more\ncomplicated implementation as opposed to having the client specify the size\nup-front (or storing the size along with the digest in every message where\ndigests are embedded). This does mean that the API leaks some implementation\ndetails of (what we consider to be) a reasonable server implementation, but\nwe consider this to be a worthwhile tradeoff.\n\nWhen a `Digest` is used to refer to a proto message, it always refers to the\nmessage in binary encoded form. To ensure consistent hashing, clients and\nservers MUST ensure that they serialize messages according to the following\nrules, even if there are alternate valid encodings for the same message.\n- Fields are serialized in tag order.\n- There are no unknown fields.\n- There are no duplicate fields.\n- Fields are serialized according to the default semantics for their type.\n\nMost protocol buffer implementations will always follow these rules when\nserializing, but care should be taken to avoid shortcuts.

The path strings must be sorted by code\n    point, equivalently, by UTF-8 bytes.\n\nA `Directory` that obeys the restrictions is said to be in canonical form.\n\nAs an example, the following could be used for a file named `bar` and a\ndirectory named `foo` with an executable file named `baz` (hashes shortened\nfor readability):\n\n```json\n// (Directory proto)\n{\n  files: [\n    {\n      name: \"bar\",\n      digest: {\n        hash: \"4a73bc9d03...\",\n        size: 65534\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  directories: [\n    {\n      name: \"foo\",\n      digest: {\n        hash: \"4cf2eda940...\",\n        size: 43\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n// (Directory proto with hash \"4cf2eda940...\" and size 43)\n{\n  files: [\n    {\n      name: \"baz\",\n      digest: {\n        hash: \"b2c941073e...\",\n        size: 1294,\n      },\n      is_executable: true\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

It is\nused by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:\n\n- Simple to use and understand for most users\n- Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs\n\n# Overview\n\nThe `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error\nmessage, and error details. The error code should be an enum value of\ngoogle.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes if needed.  The\nerror message should be a developer-facing English message that helps\ndevelopers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing\nerror message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or\nlocalize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary\ninformation about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types\nin the package `google.rpc` that can be used for common error conditions.\n\n# Language mapping\n\nThe `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it\nis not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is\nexposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be\nmapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions\nin Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.\n\n# Other uses\n\nThe error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of\nenvironments, either with or without APIs, to provide a\nconsistent developer experience across different environments.\n\nExample uses of this error model include:\n\n- Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,\n    it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial\n    errors.\n\n- Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may\n    have a `Status` message for error reporting.\n\n- Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the\n    `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for\n    each error sub-response.\n\n- Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation\n    results in its response, the status of those operations should be\n    represented directly using the `Status` message.\n\n- Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could\n    be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.",
