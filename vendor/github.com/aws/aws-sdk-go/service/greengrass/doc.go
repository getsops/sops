// Package greengrass provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS Greengrass.
//
// AWS Greengrass seamlessly extends AWS onto physical devices so they can act
// locally on the data they generate, while still using the cloud for management,
// analytics, and durable storage. AWS Greengrass ensures your devices can respond
// quickly to local events and operate with intermittent connectivity. AWS Greengrass
// minimizes the cost of transmitting data to the cloud by allowing you to author
// AWS Lambda functions that execute locally.
//
// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/greengrass-2017-06-07 for more information on this service.

// See greengrass package documentation for more information.

//
// Using the Client
//
// To AWS Greengrass with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.

// See aws.Config documentation for more information on configuring SDK clients.
