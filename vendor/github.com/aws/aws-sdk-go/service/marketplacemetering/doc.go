// Package marketplacemetering provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWSMarketplace Metering.
//
// This reference provides descriptions of the low-level AWS Marketplace Metering
// Service API.
//
// AWS Marketplace sellers can use this API to submit usage data for custom
// usage dimensions.
//
// Submitting Metering Records
//
//    * MeterUsage- Submits the metering record for a Marketplace product. MeterUsage
//    is called from an EC2 instance.
//
//    * BatchMeterUsage- Submits the metering record for a set of customers.
//    BatchMeterUsage is called from a software-as-a-service (SaaS) application.
//
// Accepting New Customers
//
//    * ResolveCustomer- Called by a SaaS application during the registration
//    process. When a buyer visits your website during the registration process,
//    the buyer submits a Registration Token through the browser. The Registration
//    Token is resolved through this API to obtain a CustomerIdentifier and
//    Product Code.
