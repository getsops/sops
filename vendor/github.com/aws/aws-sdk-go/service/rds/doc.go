// Package rds provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Amazon Relational Database Service.
//
//
// Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes
// it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud.
// It provides cost-efficient, resizable capacity for an industry-standard relational
// database and manages common database administration tasks, freeing up developers
// to focus on what makes their applications and businesses unique.
//
// Amazon RDS gives you access to the capabilities of a MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL,
// Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, or Amazon Aurora database server. These capabilities
// mean that the code, applications, and tools you already use today with your
// existing databases work with Amazon RDS without modification. Amazon RDS
// automatically backs up your database and maintains the database software
// that powers your DB instance. Amazon RDS is flexible: you can scale your
// DB instance's compute resources and storage capacity to meet your application's
// demand. As with all Amazon Web Services, there are no up-front investments,
// and you pay only for the resources you use.
//
// This interface reference for Amazon RDS contains documentation for a programming
// or command line interface you can use to manage Amazon RDS. Note that Amazon
// RDS is asynchronous, which means that some interfaces might require techniques
// such as polling or callback functions to determine when a command has been
// applied. In this reference, the parameter descriptions indicate whether a
// command is applied immediately, on the next instance reboot, or during the
// maintenance window. The reference structure is as follows, and we list following
// some related topics from the user guide.

// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
