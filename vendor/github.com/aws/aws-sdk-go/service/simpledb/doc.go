// Package simpledb provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Amazon SimpleDB.
//
// Amazon SimpleDB is a web service providing the core database functions of
// data indexing and querying in the cloud. By offloading the time and effort
// associated with building and operating a web-scale database, SimpleDB provides
// developers the freedom to focus on application development.
// A traditional, clustered relational database requires a sizable upfront capital
// outlay, is complex to design, and often requires extensive and repetitive
// database administration. Amazon SimpleDB is dramatically simpler, requiring
// no schema, automatically indexing your data and providing a simple API for
// storage and access. This approach eliminates the administrative burden of
// data modeling, index maintenance, and performance tuning. Developers gain
// access to this functionality within Amazon's proven computing environment,
// are able to scale instantly, and pay only for what they use.
//
// Visit http://aws.amazon.com/simpledb/ (http://aws.amazon.com/simpledb/) for
// more information.

// See simpledb package documentation for more information.

//
// Using the Client
//
// To contact Amazon SimpleDB with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.

// See aws.Config documentation for more information on configuring SDK clients.

// See the Amazon SimpleDB client SimpleDB for more
// information on creating client for this service.
