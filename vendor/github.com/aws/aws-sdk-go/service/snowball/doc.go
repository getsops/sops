// Package snowball provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Amazon Import/Export Snowball.
//
// AWS Snowball is a petabyte-scale data transport solution that uses secure
// devices to transfer large amounts of data between your on-premises data centers
// and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). The commands described here
// provide access to the same functionality that is available in the AWS Snowball
// Management Console, which enables you to create and manage jobs for Snowball
// and Snowball Edge devices. To transfer data locally with a device, you'll
// need to use the Snowball client or the Amazon S3 API adapter for Snowball.
//
// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/snowball-2016-06-30 for more information on this service.
//
// See snowball package documentation for more information.

//
// Using the Client
//
// To contact Amazon Import/Export Snowball with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.

// See aws.Config documentation for more information on configuring SDK clients.

// information on creating client for this service.
