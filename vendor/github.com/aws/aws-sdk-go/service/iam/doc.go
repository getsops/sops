// Package iam provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS Identity and Access Management.
//
// AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that you can use
// to manage users and user permissions under your AWS account. This guide provides
// descriptions of IAM actions that you can call programmatically. For general
// information about IAM, see AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) (http://aws.amazon.com/iam/).
// For the user guide for IAM, see Using IAM (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/).
//
// AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming
// languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs
// provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to IAM and AWS. For
// example, the SDKs take care of tasks such as cryptographically signing requests
// (see below), managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For information
// about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see the Tools
// for Amazon Web Services (http://aws.amazon.com/tools/) page.
//
// We recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to
// IAM. However, you can also use the IAM Query API to make direct calls to
// the IAM web service. To learn more about the IAM Query API, see Making Query
// Requests (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/IAM_UsingQueryAPI.html)
// in the Using IAM guide. IAM supports GET and POST requests for all actions.
// That is, the API does not require you to use GET for some actions and POST
// for others. However, GET requests are subject to the limitation size of a
// URL. Therefore, for operations that require larger sizes, use a POST request.
//
// Signing Requests
//
// Requests must be signed using an access key ID and a secret access key. We
// strongly recommend that you do not use your AWS account access key ID and
// secret access key for everyday work with IAM. You can use the access key
// ID and secret access key for an IAM user or you can use the AWS Security
// Token Service to generate temporary security credentials and use those to
// sign requests.
//
// To sign requests, we recommend that you use Signature Version 4 (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html).
// If you have an existing application that uses Signature Version 2, you do
// not have to update it to use Signature Version 4. However, some operations
// now require Signature Version 4. The documentation for operations that require
// version 4 indicate this requirement.
//
// Additional Resources
//
// For more information, see the following:
//
//    * AWS Security Credentials (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-security-credentials.html).
//    This topic provides general information about the types of credentials
//    used for accessing AWS.
//
//    * IAM Best Practices (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/IAMBestPractices.html).
//    This topic presents a list of suggestions for using the IAM service to
//    help secure your AWS resources.
//
//    * Signing AWS API Requests (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html).
//    This set of topics walk you through the process of signing a request using
//    an access key ID and secret access key.

//
// Using the Client
//
// To AWS Identity and Access Management with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/
//
// See aws.Config documentation for more information on configuring SDK clients.

// information on creating client for this service.
