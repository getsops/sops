// AWS products to do tasks such as web indexing, data mining, log file analysis,
// machine learning, scientific simulation, and data warehousing.

// To Amazon Elastic MapReduce with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
