// Package sms provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS Server Migration Service.
//
// This is the AWS Sever Migration Service API Reference. It provides descriptions,
// syntax, and usage examples for each of the actions and data types for the
// AWS Sever Migration Service (AWS SMS). The topic for each action shows the
// Query API request parameters and the XML response. You can also view the
// XML request elements in the WSDL.
//
// Alternatively, you can use one of the AWS SDKs to access an API that's tailored
// to the programming language or platform that you're using. For more information,
// see AWS SDKs (http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs).

// Using the Client
//
// To contact AWS Server Migration Service with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
