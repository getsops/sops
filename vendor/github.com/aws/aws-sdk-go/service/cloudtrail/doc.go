// Package cloudtrail provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS CloudTrail.
//
// This is the CloudTrail API Reference. It provides descriptions of actions,
// data types, common parameters, and common errors for CloudTrail.
//
// CloudTrail is a web service that records AWS API calls for your AWS account
// and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. The recorded information includes
// the identity of the user, the start time of the AWS API call, the source
// IP address, the request parameters, and the response elements returned by
// the service.
//
// As an alternative to the API, you can use one of the AWS SDKs, which consist
// of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms
// (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way
// to create programmatic access to AWSCloudTrail. For example, the SDKs take
// care of cryptographically signing requests, managing errors, and retrying
// requests automatically. For information about the AWS SDKs, including how
// to download and install them, see the Tools for Amazon Web Services page
// (http://aws.amazon.com/tools/).
//
// See the AWS CloudTrail User Guide (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-user-guide.html)
// for information about the data that is included with each AWS API call listed
// in the log files.
//
// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/cloudtrail-2013-11-01 for more information on this service.
//
// See cloudtrail package documentation for more information.

//
// Using the Client
//
// To AWS CloudTrail with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.

// See aws.Config documentation for more information on configuring SDK clients.

// information on creating client for this service.
