// Package cloudwatchlogs provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.
//
// You can use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to monitor, store, and access your log
// files from Amazon EC2 instances, AWS CloudTrail, or other sources. You can
// then retrieve the associated log data from CloudWatch Logs using the CloudWatch
// console, CloudWatch Logs commands in the AWS CLI, CloudWatch Logs API, or
// CloudWatch Logs SDK.
//
// You can use CloudWatch Logs to:
//
//    * Monitor logs from EC2 instances in real-time: You can use CloudWatch
//    Logs to monitor applications and systems using log data. For example,
//    CloudWatch Logs can track the number of errors that occur in your application
//    logs and send you a notification whenever the rate of errors exceeds a
//    threshold that you specify. CloudWatch Logs uses your log data for monitoring;
//    so, no code changes are required. For example, you can monitor application
//    logs for specific literal terms (such as "NullReferenceException") or
//    count the number of occurrences of a literal term at a particular position
//    in log data (such as "404" status codes in an Apache access log). When
//    the term you are searching for is found, CloudWatch Logs reports the data
//    to a CloudWatch metric that you specify.
//
//    * Monitor AWS CloudTrail logged events: You can create alarms in CloudWatch
//    and receive notifications of particular API activity as captured by CloudTrail
//    and use the notification to perform troubleshooting.
//
//    * Archive log data: You can use CloudWatch Logs to store your log data
//    in highly durable storage. You can change the log retention setting so
//    that any log events older than this setting are automatically deleted.
//    The CloudWatch Logs agent makes it easy to quickly send both rotated and
//    non-rotated log data off of a host and into the log service. You can then
//    access the raw log data when you need it.

//
// Using the Client
//
// To Amazon CloudWatch Logs with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
