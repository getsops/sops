// Package directconnect provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS Direct Connect.
//
// AWS Direct Connect links your internal network to an AWS Direct Connect location
// over a standard 1 gigabit or 10 gigabit Ethernet fiber-optic cable. One end
// of the cable is connected to your router, the other to an AWS Direct Connect
// router. With this connection in place, you can create virtual interfaces
// directly to the AWS cloud (for example, to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon
// EC2) and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)) and to Amazon Virtual
// Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), bypassing Internet service providers in your
// network path. An AWS Direct Connect location provides access to AWS in the
// region it is associated with, as well as access to other US regions. For
// example, you can provision a single connection to any AWS Direct Connect
// location in the US and use it to access public AWS services in all US Regions
// and AWS GovCloud (US).

// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/directconnect-2012-10-25 for more information on this service.

//
// Using the Client
//
// To AWS Direct Connect with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
