// Package directconnect provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS Direct Connect.
//
// AWS Direct Connect links your internal network to an AWS Direct Connect location
// over a standard Ethernet fiber-optic cable. One end of the cable is connected
// to your router, the other to an AWS Direct Connect router. With this connection
// in place, you can create virtual interfaces directly to the AWS cloud (for
// example, to Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3) and to Amazon VPC, bypassing Internet
// service providers in your network path. A connection provides access to all
// AWS Regions except the China (Beijing) and (China) Ningxia Regions. AWS resources
// in the China Regions can only be accessed through locations associated with
// those Regions.
//
// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/directconnect-2012-10-25 for more information on this service.

//
// Using the Client
//
// To contact AWS Direct Connect with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
