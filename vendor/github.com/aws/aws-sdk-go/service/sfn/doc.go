// Package sfn provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS Step Functions.
//
// AWS Step Functions is a service that lets you coordinate the components of
// distributed applications and microservices using visual workflows.
//
// You can use Step Functions to build applications from individual components,
// each of which performs a discrete function, or task, allowing you to scale
// and change applications quickly. Step Functions provides a console that helps
// visualize the components of your application as a series of steps. Step Functions
// automatically triggers and tracks each step, and retries steps when there
// are errors, so your application executes predictably and in the right order
// every time. Step Functions logs the state of each step, so you can quickly
// diagnose and debug any issues.
//
// Step Functions manages operations and underlying infrastructure to ensure
// your application is available at any scale. You can run tasks on AWS, your
// own servers, or any system that has access to AWS. You can access and use
// Step Functions using the console, the AWS SDKs, or an HTTP API. For more
// information about Step Functions, see the AWS Step Functions Developer Guide
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/welcome.html) .

// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/states-2016-11-23 for more information on this service.

//
// Using the Client
//
// To contact AWS Step Functions with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/

// See aws.Config documentation for more information on configuring SDK clients.

// information on creating client for this service.
