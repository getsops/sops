// Package sfn provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS Step Functions.
//
// AWS Step Functions is a web service that enables you to coordinate the components
// of distributed applications and microservices using visual workflows. You
// build applications from individual components that each perform a discrete
// function, or task, allowing you to scale and change applications quickly.
// Step Functions provides a graphical console to visualize the components of
// your application as a series of steps. It automatically triggers and tracks
// each step, and retries when there are errors, so your application executes
// in order and as expected, every time. Step Functions logs the state of each
// step, so when things do go wrong, you can diagnose and debug problems quickly.
//
// Step Functions manages the operations and underlying infrastructure for you
// to ensure your application is available at any scale. You can run tasks on
// the AWS cloud, on your own servers, or an any system that has access to AWS.
// Step Functions can be accessed and used with the Step Functions console,
// the AWS SDKs (included with your Beta release invitation email), or an HTTP
// API (the subject of this document).
//
// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/states-2016-11-23 for more information on this service.
//
// See sfn package documentation for more information.

//
// Using the Client
//
// To AWS Step Functions with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/
//
// See aws.Config documentation for more information on configuring SDK clients.

//
// See the AWS Step Functions client SFN for more
// information on creating client for this service.
