// Package connect provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Amazon Connect Service.
//
// The Amazon Connect API Reference provides descriptions, syntax, and usage
// examples for each of the Amazon Connect actions, data types, parameters,
// and errors. Amazon Connect is a cloud-based contact center solution that
// makes it easy to set up and manage a customer contact center and provide
// reliable customer engagement at any scale.
//
// Throttling limits for the Amazon Connect API operations:
//
// For the GetMetricData and GetCurrentMetricData operations, a RateLimit of
// 5 per second, and a BurstLimit of 8 per second.
//
// For all other operations, a RateLimit of 2 per second, and a BurstLimit of
// 5 per second.
//
// You can request an increase to the throttling limits by submitting a Amazon
// Connect service limits increase form (https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase).
// You must be signed in to your AWS account to access the form.

// Using the Client

// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
