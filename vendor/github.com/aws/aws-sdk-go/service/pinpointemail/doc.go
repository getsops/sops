// Package pinpointemail provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Amazon Pinpoint Email Service.
//
// This document contains reference information for the Amazon Pinpoint (https://aws.amazon.com/pinpoint)
// Email API, version 1.0. This document is best used in conjunction with the
// Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/welcome.html).
//
// The Amazon Pinpoint Email API is available in several AWS Regions and it
// provides an endpoint for each of these Regions. For a list of all the Regions
// and endpoints where the API is currently available, see AWS Regions and Endpoints
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#pinpoint_region)
// in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.
//
// In each Region, AWS maintains multiple Availability Zones. These Availability
// Zones are physically isolated from each other, but are united by private,
// low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant network connections. These
// Availability Zones enable us to provide very high levels of availability
// and redundancy, while also minimizing latency. To learn more about the number
// of Availability Zones that are available in each Region, see AWS Global Infrastructure
// (http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/).
//
// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/pinpoint-email-2018-07-26 for more information on this service.

//
// Using the Client
//
// To contact Amazon Pinpoint Email Service with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
