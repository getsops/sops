// Package cloudwatchevents provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Amazon CloudWatch Events.
//
// Amazon CloudWatch Events helps you to respond to state changes in your AWS
// resources. When your resources change state, they automatically send events
// into an event stream. You can create rules that match selected events in
// the stream and route them to targets to take action. You can also use rules
// to take action on a pre-determined schedule. For example, you can configure
// rules to:
//
//    * Automatically invoke an AWS Lambda function to update DNS entries when
//    an event notifies you that Amazon EC2 instance enters the running state.
//
//    * Direct specific API records from CloudTrail to an Amazon Kinesis stream
//    for detailed analysis of potential security or availability risks.
//
//    * Periodically invoke a built-in target to create a snapshot of an Amazon
//    EBS volume.
//

// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
