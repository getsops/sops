// requests to AWS Transfer for SFTP.

// AWS Transfer for SFTP is a fully managed service that enables the transfer
// of files directly into and out of Amazon S3 using the Secure File Transfer
// Protocol (SFTP)—also known as Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol.

// for SFTP—by integrating with existing authentication systems, and providing
// DNS routing with Amazon Route 53—so nothing changes for your customers
// and partners, or their applications. With your data in S3, you can use it
// with AWS services for processing, analytics, machine learning, and archiving.
// Getting started with AWS Transfer for SFTP (AWS SFTP) is easy; there is no
