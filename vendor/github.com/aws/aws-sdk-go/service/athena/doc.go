// Package athena provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Amazon Athena.
//
// Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that lets you use standard
// SQL to analyze data directly in Amazon S3. You can point Athena at your data
// in Amazon S3 and run ad-hoc queries and get results in seconds. Athena is
// serverless, so there is no infrastructure to set up or manage. You pay only
// for the queries you run. Athena scales automatically—executing queries
// in parallel—so results are fast, even with large datasets and complex queries.
// For more information, see What is Amazon Athena (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/what-is.html)
// in the Amazon Athena User Guide.
//
// If you connect to Athena using the JDBC driver, use version 1.1.0 of the
// driver or later with the Amazon Athena API. Earlier version drivers do not
// support the API. For more information and to download the driver, see Accessing
// Amazon Athena with JDBC (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/connect-with-jdbc.html).
//
// For code samples using the AWS SDK for Java, see Examples and Code Samples
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/code-samples.html) in the Amazon
// Athena User Guide.

//
// Using the Client
//
// To contact Amazon Athena with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.

// See aws.Config documentation for more information on configuring SDK clients.

// information on creating client for this service.
