// Package gamelift provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Amazon GameLift.
//
// Amazon GameLift is a managed service for developers who need a scalable,
// dedicated server solution for their multiplayer games. Use Amazon GameLift
// for these tasks: (1) set up computing resources and deploy your game servers,
// (2) run game sessions and get players into games, (3) automatically scale
// your resources to meet player demand and manage costs, and (4) track in-depth
// metrics on game server performance and player usage.
//
// When setting up hosting resources, you can deploy your custom game server
// or use the Amazon GameLift Realtime Servers. Realtime Servers gives you the
// ability to quickly stand up lightweight, efficient game servers with the
// core Amazon GameLift infrastructure already built in.
//
// Get Amazon GameLift Tools and Resources
//
// This reference guide describes the low-level service API for Amazon GameLift
// and provides links to language-specific SDK reference topics. See also Amazon
// GameLift Tools and Resources (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-components.html).
//
// API Summary
//

//    session, request matchmaking, etc.
//
//    * Configure and manage game server resources -- Manage your Amazon GameLift
//    hosting resources, including builds, scripts, fleets, queues, and aliases.
