// Package ssm provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Amazon Simple Systems Manager (SSM).
//
// AWS Systems Manager is a collection of capabilities that helps you automate
// management tasks such as collecting system inventory, applying operating
// system (OS) patches, automating the creation of Amazon Machine Images (AMIs),
// and configuring operating systems (OSs) and applications at scale. Systems
// Manager lets you remotely and securely manage the configuration of your managed
// instances. A managed instance is any Amazon EC2 instance or on-premises machine
// in your hybrid environment that has been configured for Systems Manager.
//
// This reference is intended to be used with the AWS Systems Manager User Guide
// (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/).
//
// To get started, verify prerequisites and configure managed instances. For
// more information, see Setting Up AWS Systems Manager (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-setting-up.html)

// Using the Client
//

// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
