// Package applicationdiscoveryservice provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS Application Discovery Service.
//
// AWS Application Discovery Service helps you plan application migration projects
// by automatically identifying servers, virtual machines (VMs), software, and
// software dependencies running in your on-premises data centers. Application
// Discovery Service also collects application performance data, which can help
// you assess the outcome of your migration. The data collected by Application
// Discovery Service is securely retained in an AWS-hosted and managed database
// in the cloud. You can export the data as a CSV or XML file into your preferred
// visualization tool or cloud-migration solution to plan your migration. For
// more information, see AWS Application Discovery Service FAQ (http://aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/faqs/).
//
// Application Discovery Service offers two modes of operation:
//
//    * Agentless discovery mode is recommended for environments that use VMware
//    vCenter Server. This mode doesn't require you to install an agent on each
//    host. Agentless discovery gathers server information regardless of the
//    operating systems, which minimizes the time required for initial on-premises
//    infrastructure assessment. Agentless discovery doesn't collect information
//    about software and software dependencies. It also doesn't work in non-VMware
//    environments.
//
//    * Agent-based discovery mode collects a richer set of data than agentless
//    discovery by using the AWS Application Discovery Agent, which you install
//    on one or more hosts in your data center. The agent captures infrastructure
//    and application information, including an inventory of installed software
//    applications, system and process performance, resource utilization, and
//    network dependencies between workloads. The information collected by agents
//    is secured at rest and in transit to the Application Discovery Service
//    database in the cloud.
//
// We recommend that you use agent-based discovery for non-VMware environments
// and to collect information about software and software dependencies. You
// can also run agent-based and agentless discovery simultaneously. Use agentless
// discovery to quickly complete the initial infrastructure assessment and then
// install agents on select hosts.
//
// Application Discovery Service integrates with application discovery solutions
// from AWS Partner Network (APN) partners. Third-party application discovery
// tools can query Application Discovery Service and write to the Application
// Discovery Service database using a public API. You can then import the data
// into either a visualization tool or cloud-migration solution.
//
// Application Discovery Service doesn't gather sensitive information. All data
// is handled according to the AWS Privacy Policy (http://aws.amazon.com/privacy/).
// You can operate Application Discovery Service offline to inspect collected
// data before it is shared with the service.
//
// This API reference provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for
// each of the actions and data types for Application Discovery Service. The
// topic for each action shows the API request parameters and the response.
// Alternatively, you can use one of the AWS SDKs to access an API that is tailored
// to the programming language or platform that you're using. For more information,
// see AWS SDKs (http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs).

//
// Using the Client
//
// To contact AWS Application Discovery Service with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.

//
// See aws.Config documentation for more information on configuring SDK clients.

// See the AWS Application Discovery Service client ApplicationDiscoveryService for more
// information on creating client for this service.
