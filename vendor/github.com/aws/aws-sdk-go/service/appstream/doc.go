// 2.0 is a fully managed application streaming service. You centrally manage
// your desktop applications on AppStream 2.0 and securely deliver them to any
// computer. AppStream 2.0 manages the AWS resources required to host and run
// your applications, scales automatically, and provides access to your users
// on demand.
