// Package datapipeline provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS Data Pipeline.
//
// AWS Data Pipeline configures and manages a data-driven workflow called a
// pipeline. AWS Data Pipeline handles the details of scheduling and ensuring
// that data dependencies are met so that your application can focus on processing
// the data.
//
// AWS Data Pipeline provides a JAR implementation of a task runner called AWS
// Data Pipeline Task Runner. AWS Data Pipeline Task Runner provides logic for
// common data management scenarios, such as performing database queries and
// running data analysis using Amazon Elastic MapReduce (Amazon EMR). You can
// use AWS Data Pipeline Task Runner as your task runner, or you can write your
// own task runner to provide custom data management.
//
// AWS Data Pipeline implements two main sets of functionality. Use the first
// set to create a pipeline and define data sources, schedules, dependencies,
// and the transforms to be performed on the data. Use the second set in your
// task runner application to receive the next task ready for processing. The
// logic for performing the task, such as querying the data, running data analysis,
// or converting the data from one format to another, is contained within the
// task runner. The task runner performs the task assigned to it by the web
// service, reporting progress to the web service as it does so. When the task
// is done, the task runner reports the final success or failure of the task
// to the web service.

//
// Using the Client
//
// To AWS Data Pipeline with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
