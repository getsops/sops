// Package serverlessapplicationrepository provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWSServerlessApplicationRepository.
//
// The AWS Serverless Application Repository makes it easy for developers and
// enterprises to quickly find and deploy serverless applications in the AWS
// Cloud. For more information about serverless applications, see Serverless
// Computing and Applications on the AWS website.
//
// The AWS Serverless Application Repository is deeply integrated with the AWS
// Lambda console, so that developers of all levels can get started with serverless
// computing without needing to learn anything new. You can use category keywords
// to browse for applications such as web and mobile backends, data processing
// applications, or chatbots. You can also search for applications by name,
// publisher, or event source. To use an application, you simply choose it,
// configure any required fields, and deploy it with a few clicks.
//
// You can also easily publish applications, sharing them publicly with the
// community at large, or privately within your team or across your organization.
// To publish a serverless application (or app), you can use the AWS Management
// Console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or AWS SDKs to upload the
// code. Along with the code, you upload a simple manifest file, also known
// as the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) template. For more information
// about AWS SAM, see AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) on the AWS
// Labs GitHub repository.
//
// The AWS Serverless Application Repository Developer Guide contains more information
// about the two developer experiences available:
//
//    * Consuming Applications – Browse for applications and view information
//    about them, including source code and readme files. Also install, configure,
//    and deploy applications of your choosing. Publishing Applications –
//    Configure and upload applications to make them available to other developers,
//    and publish new versions of applications.

//
// Using the Client
//
// To contact AWSServerlessApplicationRepository with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.

// See aws.Config documentation for more information on configuring SDK clients.
