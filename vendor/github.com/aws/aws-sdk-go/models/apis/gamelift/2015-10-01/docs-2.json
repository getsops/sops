  "service": "<fullname>Amazon GameLift Service</fullname> <p> Amazon GameLift is a managed service for developers who need a scalable, dedicated server solution for their multiplayer games. Amazon GameLift provides tools for the following tasks: (1) acquire computing resources and deploy game servers, (2) scale game server capacity to meet player demand, (3) host game sessions and manage player access, and (4) track in-depth metrics on player usage and server performance.</p> <p>The Amazon GameLift service API includes two important function sets:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Manage game sessions and player access</b> -- Retrieve information on available game sessions; create new game sessions; send player requests to join a game session.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Configure and manage game server resources</b> -- Manage builds, fleets, queues, and aliases; set autoscaling policies; retrieve logs and metrics.</p> </li> </ul> <p>This reference guide describes the low-level service API for Amazon GameLift. You can use the API functionality with these tools: </p> <ul> <li> <p>The Amazon Web Services software development kit (<a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#sdk\">AWS SDK</a>) is available in <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-supported.html#gamelift-supported-clients\">multiple languages</a> including C++ and C#. Use the SDK to access the API programmatically from an application, such as a game client.</p> </li> <li> <p>The <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/cli/\">AWS command-line interface</a> (CLI) tool is primarily useful for handling administrative actions, such as setting up and managing Amazon GameLift settings and resources. You can use the AWS CLI to manage all of your AWS services.</p> </li> <li> <p>The <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/home\">AWS Management Console</a> for Amazon GameLift provides a web interface to manage your Amazon GameLift settings and resources. The console includes a dashboard for tracking key resources, including builds and fleets, and displays usage and performance metrics for your games as customizable graphs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Amazon GameLift Local is a tool for testing your game's integration with Amazon GameLift before deploying it on the service. This tools supports a subset of key API actions, which can be called from either the AWS CLI or programmatically.

    "AcceptMatch": "<p>Registers a player's acceptance or rejection of a proposed FlexMatch match. A matchmaking configuration may require player acceptance; if so, then matches built with that configuration cannot be completed unless all players accept the proposed match within a specified time limit. </p> <p>When FlexMatch builds a match, all the matchmaking tickets involved in the proposed match are placed into status <code>REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE</code>. This is a trigger for your game to get acceptance from all players in the ticket. Acceptances are only valid for tickets when they are in this status; all other acceptances result in an error.</p> <p>To register acceptance, specify the ticket ID, a response, and one or more players. Once all players have registered acceptance, the matchmaking tickets advance to status <code>PLACING</code>, where a new game session is created for the match. </p> <p>If any player rejects the match, or if acceptances are not received before a specified timeout, the proposed match is dropped. The matchmaking tickets are then handled in one of two ways: For tickets where all players accepted the match, the ticket status is returned to <code>SEARCHING</code> to find a new match. For tickets where one or more players failed to accept the match, the ticket status is set to <code>FAILED</code>, and processing is terminated. A new matchmaking request for these players can be submitted as needed. </p> <p>Matchmaking-related operations include:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>StartMatchmaking</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeMatchmaking</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>StopMatchmaking</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>AcceptMatch</a> </p> </li> </ul>",
    "CreateAlias": "<p>Creates an alias for a fleet. In most situations, you can use an alias ID in place of a fleet ID. By using a fleet alias instead of a specific fleet ID, you can switch gameplay and players to a new fleet without changing your game client or other game components. For example, for games in production, using an alias allows you to seamlessly redirect your player base to a new game server update. </p> <p>Amazon GameLift supports two types of routing strategies for aliases: simple and terminal. A simple alias points to an active fleet. A terminal alias is used to display messaging or link to a URL instead of routing players to an active fleet. For example, you might use a terminal alias when a game version is no longer supported and you want to direct players to an upgrade site. </p> <p>To create a fleet alias, specify an alias name, routing strategy, and optional description. Each simple alias can point to only one fleet, but a fleet can have multiple aliases. If successful, a new alias record is returned, including an alias ID, which you can reference when creating a game session. You can reassign an alias to another fleet by calling <code>UpdateAlias</code>.</p> <p>Alias-related operations include:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>CreateAlias</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ListAliases</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeAlias</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>UpdateAlias</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DeleteAlias</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ResolveAlias</a> </p> </li> </ul>",

    "CreateFleet": "<p>Creates a new fleet to run your game servers. A fleet is a set of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, each of which can run multiple server processes to host game sessions. You configure a fleet to create instances with certain hardware specifications (see <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/\">Amazon EC2 Instance Types</a> for more information), and deploy a specified game build to each instance. A newly created fleet passes through several statuses; once it reaches the <code>ACTIVE</code> status, it can begin hosting game sessions.</p> <p>To create a new fleet, you must specify the following: (1) fleet name, (2) build ID of an uploaded game build, (3) an EC2 instance type, and (4) a run-time configuration that describes which server processes to run on each instance in the fleet. (Although the run-time configuration is not a required parameter, the fleet cannot be successfully activated without it.)</p> <p>You can also configure the new fleet with the following settings:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Fleet description</p> </li> <li> <p>Access permissions for inbound traffic</p> </li> <li> <p>Fleet-wide game session protection</p> </li> <li> <p>Resource creation limit</p> </li> </ul> <p>If you use Amazon CloudWatch for metrics, you can add the new fleet to a metric group. This allows you to view aggregated metrics for a set of fleets. Once you specify a metric group, the new fleet's metrics are included in the metric group's data.</p> <p>You have the option of creating a VPC peering connection with the new fleet.

    "CreateGameSession": "<p>Creates a multiplayer game session for players. This action creates a game session record and assigns an available server process in the specified fleet to host the game session. A fleet must have an <code>ACTIVE</code> status before a game session can be created in it.</p> <p>To create a game session, specify either fleet ID or alias ID and indicate a maximum number of players to allow in the game session.

    "CreateGameSessionQueue": "<p>Establishes a new queue for processing requests to place new game sessions. A queue identifies where new game sessions can be hosted -- by specifying a list of destinations (fleets or aliases) -- and how long requests can wait in the queue before timing out. You can set up a queue to try to place game sessions on fleets in multiple regions. To add placement requests to a queue, call <a>StartGameSessionPlacement</a> and reference the queue name.</p> <p> <b>Destination order.</b> When processing a request for a game session, Amazon GameLift tries each destination in order until it finds one with available resources to host the new game session. A queue's default order is determined by how destinations are listed. The default order is overridden when a game session placement request provides player latency information. Player latency information enables Amazon GameLift to prioritize destinations where players report the lowest average latency, as a result placing the new game session where the majority of players will have the best possible gameplay experience.</p> <p> <b>Player latency policies.</b> For placement requests containing player latency information, use player latency policies to protect individual players from very high latencies. With a latency cap, even when a destination can deliver a low latency for most players, the game is not placed where any individual player is reporting latency higher than a policy's maximum. A queue can have multiple latency policies, which are enforced consecutively starting with the policy with the lowest latency cap. Use multiple policies to gradually relax latency controls; for example, you might set a policy with a low latency cap for the first 60 seconds, a second policy with a higher cap for the next 60 seconds, etc. </p> <p>To create a new queue, provide a name, timeout value, a list of destinations and, if desired, a set of latency policies.

For help creating rule sets, including useful examples, see the topic <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/match-intro.html\"> Adding FlexMatch to Your Game</a>.</p> <p>Once created, matchmaking rule sets cannot be changed or deleted, so we recommend checking the rule set syntax using <a>ValidateMatchmakingRuleSet</a>before creating the rule set.</p> <p>To create a matchmaking rule set, provide the set of rules and a unique name. Rule sets must be defined in the same region as the matchmaking configuration they will be used with. Rule sets cannot be edited or deleted. If you need to change a rule set, create a new one with the necessary edits and then update matchmaking configurations to use the new rule set.</p> <p>Operations related to match configurations and rule sets include:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>CreateMatchmakingConfiguration</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeMatchmakingConfigurations</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>UpdateMatchmakingConfiguration</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DeleteMatchmakingConfiguration</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>CreateMatchmakingRuleSet</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeMatchmakingRuleSets</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ValidateMatchmakingRuleSet</a> </p> </li> </ul>",

    "StartMatchmaking": "<p>Uses FlexMatch to create a game match for a group of players based on custom matchmaking rules, and starts a new game for the matched players. Each matchmaking request specifies the type of match to build (team configuration, rules for an acceptable match, etc.). The request also specifies the players to find a match for and where to host the new game session for optimal performance. A matchmaking request might start with a single player or a group of players who want to play together. FlexMatch finds additional players as needed to fill the match. Match type, rules, and the queue used to place a new game session are defined in a <code>MatchmakingConfiguration</code>. For complete information on setting up and using FlexMatch, see the topic <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/match-intro.html\"> Adding FlexMatch to Your Game</a>.</p> <p>To start matchmaking, provide a unique ticket ID, specify a matchmaking configuration, and include the players to be matched. You must also include a set of player attributes relevant for the matchmaking configuration. If successful, a matchmaking ticket is returned with status set to <code>QUEUED</code>. Track the status of the ticket to respond as needed and acquire game session connection information for successfully completed matches.</p> <p> <b>Tracking ticket status</b> -- A couple of options are available for tracking the status of matchmaking requests: </p> <ul> <li> <p>Polling -- Call <code>DescribeMatchmaking</code>. This operation returns the full ticket object, including current status and (for completed tickets) game session connection info. We recommend polling no more than once every 10 seconds.</p> </li> <li> <p>Notifications -- Get event notifications for changes in ticket status using Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS). Notifications are easy to set up (see <a>CreateMatchmakingConfiguration</a>) and typically deliver match status changes faster and more efficiently than polling. We recommend that you use polling to back up to notifications (since delivery is not guaranteed) and call <code>DescribeMatchmaking</code> only when notifications are not received within 30 seconds.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Processing a matchmaking request</b> -- FlexMatch handles a matchmaking request as follows: </p> <ol> <li> <p>Your client code submits a <code>StartMatchmaking</code> request for one or more players and tracks the status of the request ticket. </p> </li> <li> <p>FlexMatch uses this ticket and others in process to build an acceptable match. When a potential match is identified, all tickets in the proposed match are advanced to the next status. </p> </li> <li> <p>If the match requires player acceptance (set in the matchmaking configuration), the tickets move into status <code>REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE</code>. This status triggers your client code to solicit acceptance from all players in every ticket involved in the match, and then call <a>AcceptMatch</a> for each player. If any player rejects or fails to accept the match before a specified timeout, the proposed match is dropped (see <code>AcceptMatch</code> for more details).</p> </li> <li> <p>Once a match is proposed and accepted, the matchmaking tickets move into status <code>PLACING</code>. FlexMatch locates resources for a new game session using the game session queue (set in the matchmaking configuration) and creates the game session based on the match data. </p> </li> <li> <p>When the match is successfully placed, the matchmaking tickets move into <code>COMPLETED</code> status.

The compressed build has started downloading to a fleet instance for installation.</p> </li> <li> <p> FLEET_BINARY_DOWNLOAD_FAILED -- The build failed to download to the fleet instance.</p> </li> <li> <p>FLEET_CREATION_EXTRACTING_BUILD – The game server build was successfully downloaded to an instance, and the build files are now being extracted from the uploaded build and saved to an instance. Failure at this stage prevents a fleet from moving to <code>ACTIVE</code> status. Logs for this stage display a list of the files that are extracted and saved on the instance. Access the logs by using the URL in <i>PreSignedLogUrl</i>.</p> </li> <li> <p>FLEET_CREATION_RUNNING_INSTALLER – The game server build files were successfully extracted, and the Amazon GameLift is now running the build's install script (if one is included). Failure in this stage prevents a fleet from moving to <code>ACTIVE</code> status. Logs for this stage list the installation steps and whether or not the install completed successfully. Access the logs by using the URL in <i>PreSignedLogUrl</i>. </p> </li> <li> <p>FLEET_CREATION_VALIDATING_RUNTIME_CONFIG -- The build process was successful, and the Amazon GameLift is now verifying that the game server launch paths, which are specified in the fleet's run-time configuration, exist. If any listed launch path exists, Amazon GameLift tries to launch a game server process and waits for the process to report ready. Failures in this stage prevent a fleet from moving to <code>ACTIVE</code> status. Logs for this stage list the launch paths in the run-time configuration and indicate whether each is found. Access the logs by using the URL in <i>PreSignedLogUrl</i>. </p> </li> <li> <p>FLEET_STATE_VALIDATING -- Fleet status changed from <code>DOWNLOADING</code> to <code>VALIDATING</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p> FLEET_VALIDATION_LAUNCH_PATH_NOT_FOUND -- Validation of the run-time configuration failed because the executable specified in a launch path does not exist on the instance.</p> </li> <li> <p>FLEET_STATE_BUILDING -- Fleet status changed from <code>VALIDATING</code> to <code>BUILDING</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>FLEET_VALIDATION_EXECUTABLE_RUNTIME_FAILURE -- Validation of the run-time configuration failed because the executable specified in a launch path failed to run on the fleet instance.</p> </li> <li> <p>FLEET_STATE_ACTIVATING -- Fleet status changed from <code>BUILDING</code> to <code>ACTIVATING</code>. </p> </li> <li> <p> FLEET_ACTIVATION_FAILED - The fleet failed to successfully complete one of the steps in the fleet activation process. This event code indicates that the game build was successfully downloaded to a fleet instance, built, and validated, but was not able to start a server process. A possible reason for failure is that the game server is not reporting \"process ready\" to the Amazon GameLift service.</p> </li> <li> <p>FLEET_STATE_ACTIVE -- The fleet's status changed from <code>ACTIVATING</code> to <code>ACTIVE</code>.

A rule set must define one or multiple teams for the match and set minimum and maximum team sizes. For example, a rule set might describe a 4x4 match that requires all eight slots to be filled. </p> </li> <li> <p>Player attributes -- Optional. These attributes specify a set of player characteristics to evaluate when looking for a match. Matchmaking requests that use a rule set with player attributes must provide the corresponding attribute values. For example, an attribute might specify a player's skill or level.</p> </li> <li> <p>Rules -- Optional. Rules define how to evaluate potential players for a match based on player attributes. A rule might specify minimum requirements for individual players--such as each player must meet a certain skill level, or may describe an entire group--such as all teams must be evenly matched or have at least one player in a certain role. </p> </li> <li> <p>Expansions -- Optional. Expansions allow you to relax the rules after a period of time if no acceptable matches are found. This feature lets you balance getting players into games in a reasonable amount of time instead of making them wait indefinitely for the best possible match. For example, you might use an expansion to increase the maximum skill variance between players after 30 seconds.</p> </li> </ul>",
