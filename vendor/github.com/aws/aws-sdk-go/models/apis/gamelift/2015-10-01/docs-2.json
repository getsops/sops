  "operations": {
    "AcceptMatch": "<p>Registers a player's acceptance or rejection of a proposed FlexMatch match. A matchmaking configuration may require player acceptance; if so, then matches built with that configuration cannot be completed unless all players accept the proposed match within a specified time limit. </p> <p>When FlexMatch builds a match, all the matchmaking tickets involved in the proposed match are placed into status <code>REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE</code>. This is a trigger for your game to get acceptance from all players in the ticket. Acceptances are only valid for tickets when they are in this status; all other acceptances result in an error.</p> <p>To register acceptance, specify the ticket ID, a response, and one or more players. Once all players have registered acceptance, the matchmaking tickets advance to status <code>PLACING</code>, where a new game session is created for the match. </p> <p>If any player rejects the match, or if acceptances are not received before a specified timeout, the proposed match is dropped. The matchmaking tickets are then handled in one of two ways: For tickets where all players accepted the match, the ticket status is returned to <code>SEARCHING</code> to find a new match. For tickets where one or more players failed to accept the match, the ticket status is set to <code>FAILED</code>, and processing is terminated. A new matchmaking request for these players can be submitted as needed. </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>StartMatchmaking</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeMatchmaking</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>StopMatchmaking</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>AcceptMatch</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>StartMatchBackfill</a> </p> </li> </ul>",
    "CreateAlias": "<p>Creates an alias for a fleet. In most situations, you can use an alias ID in place of a fleet ID. By using a fleet alias instead of a specific fleet ID, you can switch gameplay and players to a new fleet without changing your game client or other game components. For example, for games in production, using an alias allows you to seamlessly redirect your player base to a new game server update. </p> <p>Amazon GameLift supports two types of routing strategies for aliases: simple and terminal. A simple alias points to an active fleet. A terminal alias is used to display messaging or link to a URL instead of routing players to an active fleet. For example, you might use a terminal alias when a game version is no longer supported and you want to direct players to an upgrade site. </p> <p>To create a fleet alias, specify an alias name, routing strategy, and optional description. Each simple alias can point to only one fleet, but a fleet can have multiple aliases. If successful, a new alias record is returned, including an alias ID, which you can reference when creating a game session. You can reassign an alias to another fleet by calling <code>UpdateAlias</code>.</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>CreateAlias</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ListAliases</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeAlias</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>UpdateAlias</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DeleteAlias</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ResolveAlias</a> </p> </li> </ul>",
    "CreateBuild": "<p>Creates a new Amazon GameLift build record for your game server binary files and points to the location of your game server build files in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) location. </p> <p>Game server binaries must be combined into a <code>.zip</code> file for use with Amazon GameLift. </p> <important> <p>To create new builds quickly and easily, use the AWS CLI command <b> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/gamelift/upload-build.html\">upload-build</a> </b>. This helper command uploads your build and creates a new build record in one step, and automatically handles the necessary permissions. </p> </important> <p>The <code>CreateBuild</code> operation should be used only when you need to manually upload your build files, as in the following scenarios:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Store a build file in an Amazon S3 bucket under your own AWS account. To use this option, you must first give Amazon GameLift access to that Amazon S3 bucket. To create a new build record using files in your Amazon S3 bucket, call <code>CreateBuild</code> and specify a build name, operating system, and the storage location of your game build.</p> </li> <li> <p>Upload a build file directly to Amazon GameLift's Amazon S3 account. To use this option, you first call <code>CreateBuild</code> with a build name and operating system. This action creates a new build record and returns an Amazon S3 storage location (bucket and key only) and temporary access credentials. Use the credentials to manually upload your build file to the storage location (see the Amazon S3 topic <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UploadingObjects.html\">Uploading Objects</a>). You can upload files to a location only once. </p> </li> </ul> <p>If successful, this operation creates a new build record with a unique build ID and places it in <code>INITIALIZED</code> status.

    "CreateFleet": "<p>Creates a new fleet to run your game servers. whether they are custom game builds or Realtime Servers with game-specific script. A fleet is a set of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, each of which can host multiple game sessions. When creating a fleet, you choose the hardware specifications, set some configuration options, and specify the game server to deploy on the new fleet. </p> <p>To create a new fleet, you must provide the following: (1) a fleet name, (2) an EC2 instance type and fleet type (spot or on-demand), (3) the build ID for your game build or script ID if using Realtime Servers, and (4) a run-time configuration, which determines how game servers will run on each instance in the fleet. </p> <note> <p>When creating a Realtime Servers fleet, we recommend using a minimal version of the Realtime script (see this <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/realtime-script.html#realtime-script-examples\"> working code example </a>). This will make it much easier to troubleshoot any fleet creation issues. Once the fleet is active, you can update your Realtime script as needed.</p> </note> <p>If the <code>CreateFleet</code> call is successful, Amazon GameLift performs the following tasks. You can track the process of a fleet by checking the fleet status or by monitoring fleet creation events:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Creates a fleet record. Status: <code>NEW</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Begins writing events to the fleet event log, which can be accessed in the Amazon GameLift console.</p> <p>Sets the fleet's target capacity to 1 (desired instances), which triggers Amazon GameLift to start one new EC2 instance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Downloads the game build or Realtime script to the new instance and installs it. Statuses: <code>DOWNLOADING</code>, <code>VALIDATING</code>, <code>BUILDING</code>. </p> </li> <li> <p>Starts launching server processes on the instance. If the fleet is configured to run multiple server processes per instance, Amazon GameLift staggers each launch by a few seconds.

    "CreateGameSession": "<p>Creates a multiplayer game session for players. This action creates a game session record and assigns an available server process in the specified fleet to host the game session. A fleet must have an <code>ACTIVE</code> status before a game session can be created in it.</p> <p>To create a game session, specify either fleet ID or alias ID and indicate a maximum number of players to allow in the game session.

    "CreateGameSessionQueue": "<p>Establishes a new queue for processing requests to place new game sessions. A queue identifies where new game sessions can be hosted -- by specifying a list of destinations (fleets or aliases) -- and how long requests can wait in the queue before timing out. You can set up a queue to try to place game sessions on fleets in multiple regions. To add placement requests to a queue, call <a>StartGameSessionPlacement</a> and reference the queue name.</p> <p> <b>Destination order.</b> When processing a request for a game session, Amazon GameLift tries each destination in order until it finds one with available resources to host the new game session. A queue's default order is determined by how destinations are listed. The default order is overridden when a game session placement request provides player latency information. Player latency information enables Amazon GameLift to prioritize destinations where players report the lowest average latency, as a result placing the new game session where the majority of players will have the best possible gameplay experience.</p> <p> <b>Player latency policies.</b> For placement requests containing player latency information, use player latency policies to protect individual players from very high latencies. With a latency cap, even when a destination can deliver a low latency for most players, the game is not placed where any individual player is reporting latency higher than a policy's maximum. A queue can have multiple latency policies, which are enforced consecutively starting with the policy with the lowest latency cap. Use multiple policies to gradually relax latency controls; for example, you might set a policy with a low latency cap for the first 60 seconds, a second policy with a higher cap for the next 60 seconds, etc. </p> <p>To create a new queue, provide a name, timeout value, a list of destinations and, if desired, a set of latency policies.

    "PutScalingPolicy": "<p>Creates or updates a scaling policy for a fleet. Scaling policies are used to automatically scale a fleet's hosting capacity to meet player demand. An active scaling policy instructs Amazon GameLift to track a fleet metric and automatically change the fleet's capacity when a certain threshold is reached. There are two types of scaling policies: target-based and rule-based. Use a target-based policy to quickly and efficiently manage fleet scaling; this option is the most commonly used. Use rule-based policies when you need to exert fine-grained control over auto-scaling. </p> <p>Fleets can have multiple scaling policies of each type in force at the same time; you can have one target-based policy, one or multiple rule-based scaling policies, or both. We recommend caution, however, because multiple auto-scaling policies can have unintended consequences.</p> <p>You can temporarily suspend all scaling policies for a fleet by calling <a>StopFleetActions</a> with the fleet action AUTO_SCALING. To resume scaling policies, call <a>StartFleetActions</a> with the same fleet action. To stop just one scaling policy--or to permanently remove it, you must delete the policy with <a>DeleteScalingPolicy</a>.</p> <p>Learn more about how to work with auto-scaling in <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-autoscaling.html\">Set Up Fleet Automatic Scaling</a>.</p> <p> <b>Target-based policy</b> </p> <p>A target-based policy tracks a single metric: PercentAvailableGameSessions. This metric tells us how much of a fleet's hosting capacity is ready to host game sessions but is not currently in use. This is the fleet's buffer; it measures the additional player demand that the fleet could handle at current capacity. With a target-based policy, you set your ideal buffer size and leave it to Amazon GameLift to take whatever action is needed to maintain that target. </p> <p>For example, you might choose to maintain a 10% buffer for a fleet that has the capacity to host 100 simultaneous game sessions. This policy tells Amazon GameLift to take action whenever the fleet's available capacity falls below or rises above 10 game sessions. Amazon GameLift will start new instances or stop unused instances in order to return to the 10% buffer. </p> <p>To create or update a target-based policy, specify a fleet ID and name, and set the policy type to \"TargetBased\". Specify the metric to track (PercentAvailableGameSessions) and reference a <a>TargetConfiguration</a> object with your desired buffer value. Exclude all other parameters. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. The scaling policy is automatically in force as soon as it's successfully created. If the fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.</p> <p> <b>Rule-based policy</b> </p> <p>A rule-based policy tracks specified fleet metric, sets a threshold value, and specifies the type of action to initiate when triggered. With a rule-based policy, you can select from several available fleet metrics. Each policy specifies whether to scale up or scale down (and by how much), so you need one policy for each type of action. </p> <p>For example, a policy may make the following statement: \"If the percentage of idle instances is greater than 20% for more than 15 minutes, then reduce the fleet capacity by 10%.\"</p> <p>A policy's rule statement has the following structure:</p> <p>If <code>[MetricName]</code> is <code>[ComparisonOperator]</code> <code>[Threshold]</code> for <code>[EvaluationPeriods]</code> minutes, then <code>[ScalingAdjustmentType]</code> to/by <code>[ScalingAdjustment]</code>.</p> <p>To implement the example, the rule statement would look like this:</p> <p>If <code>[PercentIdleInstances]</code> is <code>[GreaterThanThreshold]</code> <code>[20]</code> for <code>[15]</code> minutes, then <code>[PercentChangeInCapacity]</code> to/by <code>[10]</code>.</p> <p>To create or update a scaling policy, specify a unique combination of name and fleet ID, and set the policy type to \"RuleBased\". Specify the parameter values for a policy rule statement. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. Scaling policies are automatically in force as soon as they're successfully created. If the fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>DescribeFleetCapacity</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>UpdateFleetCapacity</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeEC2InstanceLimits</a> </p> </li> <li> <p>Manage scaling policies:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>PutScalingPolicy</a> (auto-scaling)</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeScalingPolicies</a> (auto-scaling)</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DeleteScalingPolicy</a> (auto-scaling)</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Manage fleet actions:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>StartFleetActions</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>StopFleetActions</a> </p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul>",

    "StartGameSessionPlacement": "<p>Places a request for a new game session in a queue (see <a>CreateGameSessionQueue</a>). When processing a placement request, Amazon GameLift searches for available resources on the queue's destinations, scanning each until it finds resources or the placement request times out.</p> <p>A game session placement request can also request player sessions. When a new game session is successfully created, Amazon GameLift creates a player session for each player included in the request.</p> <p>When placing a game session, by default Amazon GameLift tries each fleet in the order they are listed in the queue configuration. Ideally, a queue's destinations are listed in preference order.</p> <p>Alternatively, when requesting a game session with players, you can also provide latency data for each player in relevant regions. Latency data indicates the performance lag a player experiences when connected to a fleet in the region. Amazon GameLift uses latency data to reorder the list of destinations to place the game session in a region with minimal lag. If latency data is provided for multiple players, Amazon GameLift calculates each region's average lag for all players and reorders to get the best game play across all players. </p> <p>To place a new game session request, specify the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The queue name and a set of game session properties and settings</p> </li> <li> <p>A unique ID (such as a UUID) for the placement.

    "StartMatchBackfill": "<p>Finds new players to fill open slots in an existing game session. This operation can be used to add players to matched games that start with fewer than the maximum number of players or to replace players when they drop out. By backfilling with the same matchmaker used to create the original match, you ensure that new players meet the match criteria and maintain a consistent experience throughout the game session. You can backfill a match anytime after a game session has been created. </p> <p>To request a match backfill, specify a unique ticket ID, the existing game session's ARN, a matchmaking configuration, and a set of data that describes all current players in the game session. If successful, a match backfill ticket is created and returned with status set to QUEUED. The ticket is placed in the matchmaker's ticket pool and processed.

    "StartMatchmaking": "<p>Uses FlexMatch to create a game match for a group of players based on custom matchmaking rules, and starts a new game for the matched players. Each matchmaking request specifies the type of match to build (team configuration, rules for an acceptable match, etc.). The request also specifies the players to find a match for and where to host the new game session for optimal performance. A matchmaking request might start with a single player or a group of players who want to play together. FlexMatch finds additional players as needed to fill the match. Match type, rules, and the queue used to place a new game session are defined in a <code>MatchmakingConfiguration</code>. For complete information on setting up and using FlexMatch, see the topic <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/match-intro.html\"> Adding FlexMatch to Your Game</a>.</p> <p>To start matchmaking, provide a unique ticket ID, specify a matchmaking configuration, and include the players to be matched. You must also include a set of player attributes relevant for the matchmaking configuration. If successful, a matchmaking ticket is returned with status set to <code>QUEUED</code>. Track the status of the ticket to respond as needed and acquire game session connection information for successfully completed matches.</p> <p> <b>Tracking ticket status</b> -- A couple of options are available for tracking the status of matchmaking requests: </p> <ul> <li> <p>Polling -- Call <code>DescribeMatchmaking</code>. This operation returns the full ticket object, including current status and (for completed tickets) game session connection info. We recommend polling no more than once every 10 seconds.</p> </li> <li> <p>Notifications -- Get event notifications for changes in ticket status using Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS). Notifications are easy to set up (see <a>CreateMatchmakingConfiguration</a>) and typically deliver match status changes faster and more efficiently than polling. We recommend that you use polling to back up to notifications (since delivery is not guaranteed) and call <code>DescribeMatchmaking</code> only when notifications are not received within 30 seconds.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Processing a matchmaking request</b> -- FlexMatch handles a matchmaking request as follows: </p> <ol> <li> <p>Your client code submits a <code>StartMatchmaking</code> request for one or more players and tracks the status of the request ticket. </p> </li> <li> <p>FlexMatch uses this ticket and others in process to build an acceptable match. When a potential match is identified, all tickets in the proposed match are advanced to the next status. </p> </li> <li> <p>If the match requires player acceptance (set in the matchmaking configuration), the tickets move into status <code>REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE</code>. This status triggers your client code to solicit acceptance from all players in every ticket involved in the match, and then call <a>AcceptMatch</a> for each player. If any player rejects or fails to accept the match before a specified timeout, the proposed match is dropped (see <code>AcceptMatch</code> for more details).</p> </li> <li> <p>Once a match is proposed and accepted, the matchmaking tickets move into status <code>PLACING</code>. FlexMatch locates resources for a new game session using the game session queue (set in the matchmaking configuration) and creates the game session based on the match data. </p> </li> <li> <p>When the match is successfully placed, the matchmaking tickets move into <code>COMPLETED</code> status. Connection information (including game session endpoint and player session) is added to the matchmaking tickets. Matched players can use the connection information to join the game. </p> </li> </ol> <ul> <li> <p> <a>StartMatchmaking</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeMatchmaking</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>StopMatchmaking</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>AcceptMatch</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>StartMatchBackfill</a> </p> </li> </ul>",

The compressed build has started downloading to a fleet instance for installation.</p> </li> <li> <p> FLEET_BINARY_DOWNLOAD_FAILED -- The build failed to download to the fleet instance.</p> </li> <li> <p>FLEET_CREATION_EXTRACTING_BUILD – The game server build was successfully downloaded to an instance, and the build files are now being extracted from the uploaded build and saved to an instance. Failure at this stage prevents a fleet from moving to <code>ACTIVE</code> status. Logs for this stage display a list of the files that are extracted and saved on the instance. Access the logs by using the URL in <i>PreSignedLogUrl</i>.</p> </li> <li> <p>FLEET_CREATION_RUNNING_INSTALLER – The game server build files were successfully extracted, and the Amazon GameLift is now running the build's install script (if one is included). Failure in this stage prevents a fleet from moving to <code>ACTIVE</code> status. Logs for this stage list the installation steps and whether or not the install completed successfully. Access the logs by using the URL in <i>PreSignedLogUrl</i>. </p> </li> <li> <p>FLEET_CREATION_VALIDATING_RUNTIME_CONFIG -- The build process was successful, and the Amazon GameLift is now verifying that the game server launch paths, which are specified in the fleet's run-time configuration, exist. If any listed launch path exists, Amazon GameLift tries to launch a game server process and waits for the process to report ready. Failures in this stage prevent a fleet from moving to <code>ACTIVE</code> status. Logs for this stage list the launch paths in the run-time configuration and indicate whether each is found. Access the logs by using the URL in <i>PreSignedLogUrl</i>. </p> </li> <li> <p>FLEET_STATE_VALIDATING -- Fleet status changed from <code>DOWNLOADING</code> to <code>VALIDATING</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p> FLEET_VALIDATION_LAUNCH_PATH_NOT_FOUND -- Validation of the run-time configuration failed because the executable specified in a launch path does not exist on the instance.</p> </li> <li> <p>FLEET_STATE_BUILDING -- Fleet status changed from <code>VALIDATING</code> to <code>BUILDING</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>FLEET_VALIDATION_EXECUTABLE_RUNTIME_FAILURE -- Validation of the run-time configuration failed because the executable specified in a launch path failed to run on the fleet instance.</p> </li> <li> <p>FLEET_STATE_ACTIVATING -- Fleet status changed from <code>BUILDING</code> to <code>ACTIVATING</code>. </p> </li> <li> <p> FLEET_ACTIVATION_FAILED - The fleet failed to successfully complete one of the steps in the fleet activation process. This event code indicates that the game build was successfully downloaded to a fleet instance, built, and validated, but was not able to start a server process. A possible reason for failure is that the game server is not reporting \"process ready\" to the Amazon GameLift service.</p> </li> <li> <p>FLEET_STATE_ACTIVE -- The fleet's status changed from <code>ACTIVATING</code> to <code>ACTIVE</code>.
