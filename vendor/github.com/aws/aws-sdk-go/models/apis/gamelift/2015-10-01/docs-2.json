  "service": "<fullname>Amazon GameLift Service</fullname> <p> Amazon GameLift is a managed service for developers who need a scalable, dedicated server solution for their multiplayer games. Amazon GameLift provides tools to acquire computing resources and deploy game servers, scale game server capacity to meet player demand, and track in-depth metrics on player usage and server performance.</p> <p>The Amazon GameLift service API includes important features:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Find game sessions and match players to games – Retrieve information on available game sessions; create new game sessions; send player requests to join a game session.</p> </li> <li> <p>Configure and manage game server resources – Manage builds, fleets, queues, and aliases; set autoscaling policies; retrieve logs and metrics.</p> </li> </ul> <p>This reference guide describes the low-level service API for Amazon GameLift. We recommend using either the Amazon Web Services software development kit (<a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#sdk\">AWS SDK</a>), available in multiple languages, or the <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/cli/\">AWS command-line interface</a> (CLI) tool. Both of these align with the low-level service API. In addition, you can use the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/home\">AWS Management Console</a> for Amazon GameLift for many administrative actions.</p> <p>You can use some API actions with Amazon GameLift Local, a testing tool that lets you test your game integration locally before deploying on Amazon GameLift. You can call these APIs from the AWS CLI or programmatically; API calls to Amazon GameLift Local servers perform exactly as they do when calling Amazon GameLift web servers. For more information on using Amazon GameLift Local, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/integration-testing-local.html\">Testing an Integration</a>.</p> <p> <b>MORE RESOURCES</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/\">Amazon GameLift Developer Guide</a> – Learn more about Amazon GameLift features and how to use them. </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://gamedev.amazon.com/forums/tutorials\">Lumberyard and Amazon GameLift Tutorials</a> – Get started fast with walkthroughs and sample projects.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/gamedev/\">GameDev Blog</a> – Stay up to date with new features and techniques.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://gamedev.amazon.com/forums/spaces/123/gamelift-discussion.html\">GameDev Forums</a> – Connect with the GameDev community.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/doc-history.html\">Amazon GameLift Document History</a> – See changes to the Amazon GameLift service, SDKs, and documentation, as well as links to release notes. </p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>API SUMMARY</b> </p> <p>This list offers a functional overview of the Amazon GameLift service API.</p> <p> <b>Finding Games and Joining Players</b> </p> <p>You can enable players to connect to game servers on Amazon GameLift from a game client or through a game service (such as a matchmaking service).

  "operations": {
    "CreateAlias": "<p>Creates an alias and sets a target fleet. A fleet alias can be used in place of a fleet ID, such as when calling <code>CreateGameSession</code> from a game client or game service or adding destinations to a game session queue. By changing an alias's target fleet, you can switch your players to the new fleet without changing any other component. In production, this feature is particularly useful to redirect your player base seamlessly to the latest game server update. </p> <p>Amazon GameLift supports two types of routing strategies for aliases: simple and terminal. Use a simple alias to point to an active fleet. Use a terminal alias to display a message to incoming traffic instead of routing players to an active fleet. This option is useful when a game server is no longer supported but you want to provide better messaging than a standard 404 error.</p> <p>To create a fleet alias, specify an alias name, routing strategy, and optional description. If successful, a new alias record is returned, including an alias ID, which you can reference when creating a game session. To reassign the alias to another fleet ID, call <a>UpdateAlias</a>.</p>",
    "CreateBuild": "<p>Creates a new Amazon GameLift build from a set of game server binary files stored in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) location. When using this API call, you must create a <code>.zip</code> file containing all of the build files and store it in an Amazon S3 bucket under your AWS account. For help on packaging your build files and creating a build, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-build-intro.html\">Uploading Your Game to Amazon GameLift</a>.</p> <important> <p>Use this API action ONLY if you are storing your game build files in an Amazon S3 bucket in your AWS account. To create a build using files stored in a directory, use the CLI command <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/gamelift/upload-build.html\"> <code>upload-build</code> </a>, which uploads the build files from a file location you specify and creates a build.</p> </important> <p>To create a new build using <code>CreateBuild</code>, identify the storage location and operating system of your game build. You also have the option of specifying a build name and version. If successful, this action creates a new build record with an unique build ID and in <code>INITIALIZED</code> status. Use the API call <a>DescribeBuild</a> to check the status of your build. A build must be in <code>READY</code> status before it can be used to create fleets to host your game.</p>",
    "CreateFleet": "<p>Creates a new fleet to run your game servers. A fleet is a set of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, each of which can run multiple server processes to host game sessions. You configure a fleet to create instances with certain hardware specifications (see <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/\">Amazon EC2 Instance Types</a> for more information), and deploy a specified game build to each instance. A newly created fleet passes through several statuses; once it reaches the <code>ACTIVE</code> status, it can begin hosting game sessions.</p> <p>To create a new fleet, provide a fleet name, an EC2 instance type, and a build ID of the game build to deploy. You can also configure the new fleet with the following settings: (1) a runtime configuration describing what server processes to run on each instance in the fleet (required to create fleet), (2) access permissions for inbound traffic, (3) fleet-wide game session protection, and (4) the location of default log files for Amazon GameLift to upload and store.</p> <p>If the CreateFleet call is successful, Amazon GameLift performs the following tasks:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Creates a fleet record and sets the status to <code>NEW</code> (followed by other statuses as the fleet is activated).</p> </li> <li> <p>Sets the fleet's capacity to 1 \"desired\", which causes Amazon GameLift to start one new EC2 instance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Starts launching server processes on the instance. If the fleet is configured to run multiple server processes per instance, Amazon GameLift staggers each launch by a few seconds.</p> </li> <li> <p>Begins writing events to the fleet event log, which can be accessed in the Amazon GameLift console.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sets the fleet's status to <code>ACTIVE</code> once one server process in the fleet is ready to host a game session.</p> </li> </ul> <p>After a fleet is created, use the following actions to change fleet properties and configuration:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>UpdateFleetAttributes</a> -- Update fleet metadata, including name and description.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>UpdateFleetCapacity</a> -- Increase or decrease the number of instances you want the fleet to maintain.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>UpdateFleetPortSettings</a> -- Change the IP address and port ranges that allow access to incoming traffic.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>UpdateRuntimeConfiguration</a> -- Change how server processes are launched in the fleet, including launch path, launch parameters, and the number of concurrent processes.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>PutScalingPolicy</a> -- Create or update rules that are used to set the fleet's capacity (autoscaling).</p> </li> </ul>",
    "CreateGameSession": "<p>Creates a multiplayer game session for players. This action creates a game session record and assigns an available server process in the specified fleet to host the game session. A fleet must have an <code>ACTIVE</code> status before a game session can be created in it.</p> <p>To create a game session, specify either fleet ID or alias ID and indicate a maximum number of players to allow in the game session. You can also provide a name and game-specific properties for this game session. If successful, a <a>GameSession</a> object is returned containing game session properties, including a game session ID with the custom string you provided.</p> <p> <b>Idempotency tokens.</b> You can add a token that uniquely identifies game session requests. This is useful for ensuring that game session requests are idempotent. Multiple requests with the same idempotency token are processed only once; subsequent requests return the original result. All response values are the same with the exception of game session status, which may change.</p> <p> <b>Resource creation limits.</b> If you are creating a game session on a fleet with a resource creation limit policy in force, then you must specify a creator ID. Without this ID, Amazon GameLift has no way to evaluate the policy for this new game session request.</p> <p> By default, newly created game sessions allow new players to join. Use <a>UpdateGameSession</a> to change the game session's player session creation policy.</p> <p> <i>Available in Amazon GameLift Local.</i> </p>",
    "CreateGameSessionQueue": "<p>Establishes a new queue for processing requests to place new game sessions. A queue identifies where new game sessions can be hosted -- by specifying a list of destinations (fleets or aliases) -- and how long requests can wait in the queue before timing out. You can set up a queue to try to place game sessions on fleets in multiple regions. To add placement requests to a queue, call <a>StartGameSessionPlacement</a> and reference the queue name.</p> <p> <b>Destination order.</b> When processing a request for a game session, Amazon GameLift tries each destination in order until it finds one with available resources to host the new game session. A queue's default order is determined by how destinations are listed. The default order is overridden when a game session placement request provides player latency information. Player latency information enables Amazon GameLift to prioritize destinations where players report the lowest average latency, as a result placing the new game session where the majority of players will have the best possible gameplay experience.</p> <p> <b>Player latency policies.</b> For placement requests containing player latency information, use player latency policies to protect individual players from very high latencies. With a latency cap, even when a destination can deliver a low latency for most players, the game is not placed where any individual player is reporting latency higher than a policy's maximum. A queue can have multiple latency policies, which are enforced consecutively starting with the policy with the lowest latency cap. Use multiple policies to gradually relax latency controls; for example, you might set a policy with a low latency cap for the first 60 seconds, a second policy with a higher cap for the next 60 seconds, etc. </p> <p>To create a new queue, provide a name, timeout value, a list of destinations and, if desired, a set of latency policies. If successful, a new queue object is returned.</p>",
    "CreatePlayerSession": "<p>Adds a player to a game session and creates a player session record. Before a player can be added, a game session must have an <code>ACTIVE</code> status, have a creation policy of <code>ALLOW_ALL</code>, and have an open player slot. To add a group of players to a game session, use <a>CreatePlayerSessions</a>.</p> <p>To create a player session, specify a game session ID, player ID, and optionally a string of player data. If successful, the player is added to the game session and a new <a>PlayerSession</a> object is returned. Player sessions cannot be updated. </p> <p> <i>Available in Amazon GameLift Local.</i> </p>",
    "CreatePlayerSessions": "<p>Adds a group of players to a game session. This action is useful with a team matching feature. Before players can be added, a game session must have an <code>ACTIVE</code> status, have a creation policy of <code>ALLOW_ALL</code>, and have an open player slot. To add a single player to a game session, use <a>CreatePlayerSession</a>.</p> <p>To create player sessions, specify a game session ID, a list of player IDs, and optionally a set of player data strings. If successful, the players are added to the game session and a set of new <a>PlayerSession</a> objects is returned. Player sessions cannot be updated.</p> <p> <i>Available in Amazon GameLift Local.</i> </p>",
    "DeleteAlias": "<p>Deletes a fleet alias. This action removes all record of the alias. Game clients attempting to access a server process using the deleted alias receive an error. To delete an alias, specify the alias ID to be deleted.</p>",
    "DeleteBuild": "<p>Deletes a build. This action permanently deletes the build record and any uploaded build files.</p> <p>To delete a build, specify its ID. Deleting a build does not affect the status of any active fleets using the build, but you can no longer create new fleets with the deleted build.</p>",
    "DeleteFleet": "<p>Deletes everything related to a fleet. Before deleting a fleet, you must set the fleet's desired capacity to zero. See <a>UpdateFleetCapacity</a>.</p> <p>This action removes the fleet's resources and the fleet record. Once a fleet is deleted, you can no longer use that fleet.</p>",
    "DeleteGameSessionQueue": "<p>Deletes a game session queue. This action means that any <a>StartGameSessionPlacement</a> requests that reference this queue will fail. To delete a queue, specify the queue name.</p>",
    "DeleteScalingPolicy": "<p>Deletes a fleet scaling policy. This action means that the policy is no longer in force and removes all record of it. To delete a scaling policy, specify both the scaling policy name and the fleet ID it is associated with.</p>",
    "DescribeAlias": "<p>Retrieves properties for a fleet alias. This operation returns all alias metadata and settings.

    "StartGameSessionPlacement": "<p>Places a request for a new game session in a queue (see <a>CreateGameSessionQueue</a>). When processing a placement request, Amazon GameLift searches for available resources on the queue's destinations, scanning each until it finds resources or the placement request times out. A game session placement request can also request player sessions. When a new game session is successfully created, Amazon GameLift creates a player session for each player included in the request.</p> <p>When placing a game session, by default Amazon GameLift tries each fleet in the order they are listed in the queue configuration. Ideally, a queue's destinations are listed in preference order. Alternatively, when requesting a game session with players, you can also provide latency data for each player in relevant regions. Latency data indicates the performance lag a player experiences when connected to a fleet in the region. Amazon GameLift uses latency data to reorder the list of destinations to place the game session in a region with minimal lag. If latency data is provided for multiple players, Amazon GameLift calculates each region's average lag for all players and reorders to get the best game play across all players. </p> <p>To place a new game session request, specify the queue name and a set of game session properties and settings. Also provide a unique ID (such as a UUID) for the placement. You'll use this ID to track the status of the placement request. Optionally, provide a set of IDs and player data for each player you want to join to the new game session. To optimize game play for the players, also provide latency data for all players. If successful, a new game session placement is created. To track the status of a placement request, call <a>DescribeGameSessionPlacement</a> and check the request's status. If the status is Fulfilled, a new game session has been created and a game session ARN and region are referenced. If the placement request times out, you have the option of resubmitting the request or retrying it with a different queue. </p>",

Existing server processes are not affected by the update; they continue to run until they end, while Amazon GameLift simply adds new server processes to fit the current runtime configuration. As a result, the runtime configuration changes are applied gradually as existing processes shut down and new processes are launched in Amazon GameLift's normal process recycling activity.</p>"

Values can be numbers, boolean values (true/false) or strings. String values are case sensitive, enclosed in single quotes. Special characters must be escaped. Boolean and string values can only be used with the comparators <code>=</code> and <code>&lt;&gt;</code>. For example, the following filter expression searches on <code>gameSessionName</code>: \"<code>FilterExpression\": \"gameSessionName = 'Matt\\\\'s Awesome Game 1'\"</code>. </p> </li> </ul> <p>To chain multiple conditions in a single expression, use the logical keywords <code>AND</code>, <code>OR</code>, and <code>NOT</code> and parentheses as needed.
