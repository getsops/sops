  "service": "<p>Amazon CloudWatch Events helps you to respond to state changes in your AWS resources. When your resources change state, they automatically send events into an event stream. You can create rules that match selected events in the stream and route them to targets to take action. You can also use rules to take action on a pre-determined schedule. For example, you can configure rules to:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Automatically invoke an AWS Lambda function to update DNS entries when an event notifies you that Amazon EC2 instance enters the running state.</p> </li> <li> <p>Direct specific API records from CloudTrail to an Amazon Kinesis stream for detailed analysis of potential security or availability risks.</p> </li> <li> <p>Periodically invoke a built-in target to create a snapshot of an Amazon EBS volume.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For more information about the features of Amazon CloudWatch Events, see the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events\">Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide</a>.</p>",

    "PutTargets": "<p>Adds the specified targets to the specified rule, or updates the targets if they are already associated with the rule.</p> <p>Targets are the resources that are invoked when a rule is triggered. Example targets include EC2 instances, AWS Lambda functions, Amazon Kinesis streams, Amazon ECS tasks, AWS Step Functions state machines, and built-in targets. Note that creating rules with built-in targets is supported only in the AWS Management Console.</p> <p>For some target types, <code>PutTargets</code> provides target-specific parameters. If the target is an Amazon Kinesis stream, you can optionally specify which shard the event goes to by using the <code>KinesisParameters</code> argument. To invoke a command on multiple EC2 instances with one rule, you can use the <code>RunCommandParameters</code> field.</p> <p>To be able to make API calls against the resources that you own, Amazon CloudWatch Events needs the appropriate permissions. For AWS Lambda and Amazon SNS resources, CloudWatch Events relies on resource-based policies. For EC2 instances, Amazon Kinesis streams, and AWS Step Functions state machines, CloudWatch Events relies on IAM roles that you specify in the <code>RoleARN</code> argument in <code>PutTarget</code>.
