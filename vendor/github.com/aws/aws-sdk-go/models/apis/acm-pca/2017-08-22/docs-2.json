Call the <a>IssueCertificate</a> operation to issue a certificate. Call the <a>RevokeCertificate</a> operation to revoke a certificate. </p> <note> <p>Certificates issued by your private CA can be trusted only within your organization, not publicly.</p> </note> <p>Your private CA can optionally create a certificate revocation list (CRL) to track the certificates you revoke.
