For each face match, the response provides a bounding box of the face, facial landmarks, pose details (pitch, role, and yaw), quality (brightness and sharpness), and confidence value (indicating the level of confidence that the bounding box contains a face). The response also provides a similarity score, which indicates how closely the faces match. </p> <note> <p>By default, only faces with a similarity score of greater than or equal to 80% are returned in the response. You can change this value by specifying the <code>SimilarityThreshold</code> parameter.</p> </note> <p> <code>CompareFaces</code> also returns an array of faces that don't match the source image.

You also specify the face recognition criteria in <code>Settings</code>. For example, the collection containing faces that you want to recognize. Use <code>Name</code> to assign an identifier for the stream processor. You use <code>Name</code> to manage the stream processor.

    "DetectFaces": "<p>Detects faces within an image that is provided as input.</p> <p> <code>DetectFaces</code> detects the 100 largest faces in the image. For each face detected, the operation returns face details. These details include a bounding box of the face, a confidence value (that the bounding box contains a face), and a fixed set of attributes such as facial landmarks (for example, coordinates of eye and mouth), gender, presence of beard, sunglasses, and so on. </p> <p>The face-detection algorithm is most effective on frontal faces. For non-frontal or obscured faces, the algorithm might not detect the faces or might detect faces with lower confidence. </p> <p>You pass the input image either as base64-encoded image bytes or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes is not supported. The image must be either a PNG or JPEG formatted file. </p> <note> <p>This is a stateless API operation.

    "DetectLabels": "<p>Detects instances of real-world entities within an image (JPEG or PNG) provided as input.

If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes is not supported. The image must be either a PNG or JPEG formatted file. </p> <p> For each object, scene, and concept the API returns one or more labels. Each label provides the object name, and the level of confidence that the image contains the object. For example, suppose the input image has a lighthouse, the sea, and a rock. The response includes all three labels, one for each object. </p> <p> <code>{Name: lighthouse, Confidence: 98.4629}</code> </p> <p> <code>{Name: rock,Confidence: 79.2097}</code> </p> <p> <code> {Name: sea,Confidence: 75.061}</code> </p> <p>In the preceding example, the operation returns one label for each of the three objects. The operation can also return multiple labels for the same object in the image. For example, if the input image shows a flower (for example, a tulip), the operation might return the following three labels. </p> <p> <code>{Name: flower,Confidence: 99.0562}</code> </p> <p> <code>{Name: plant,Confidence: 99.0562}</code> </p> <p> <code>{Name: tulip,Confidence: 99.0562}</code> </p> <p>In this example, the detection algorithm more precisely identifies the flower as a tulip.</p> <p>In response, the API returns an array of labels. In addition, the response also includes the orientation correction. Optionally, you can specify <code>MinConfidence</code> to control the confidence threshold for the labels returned. The default is 55%. You can also add the <code>MaxLabels</code> parameter to limit the number of labels returned. </p> <note> <p>If the object detected is a person, the operation doesn't provide the same facial details that the <a>DetectFaces</a> operation provides.</p> </note> <p> <code>DetectLabels</code> returns bounding boxes for instances of common object labels in an array of <a>Instance</a> objects. An <code>Instance</code> object contains a <a>BoundingBox</a> object, for the location of the label on the image. It also includes the confidence by which the bounding box was detected.</p> <p> <code>DetectLabels</code> also returns a hierarchical taxonomy of detected labels. For example, a detected car might be assigned the label <i>car</i>. The label <i>car</i> has two parent labels: <i>Vehicle</i> (its parent) and <i>Transportation</i> (its grandparent). The response returns the entire list of ancestors for a label. Each ancestor is a unique label in the response. In the previous example, <i>Car</i>, <i>Vehicle</i>, and <i>Transportation</i> are returned as unique labels in the response. </p> <p>This is a stateless API operation. That is, the operation does not persist any data.</p> <p>This operation requires permissions to perform the <code>rekognition:DetectLabels</code> action. </p>",

The image must be either a .png or .jpeg formatted file. </p> <p>The <code>DetectText</code> operation returns text in an array of <a>TextDetection</a> elements, <code>TextDetections</code>. Each <code>TextDetection</code> element provides information about a single word or line of text that was detected in the image. </p> <p>A word is one or more ISO basic latin script characters that are not separated by spaces. <code>DetectText</code> can detect up to 50 words in an image.</p> <p>A line is a string of equally spaced words. A line isn't necessarily a complete sentence. For example, a driver's license number is detected as a line. A line ends when there is no aligned text after it. Also, a line ends when there is a large gap between words, relative to the length of the words. This means, depending on the gap between words, Amazon Rekognition may detect multiple lines in text aligned in the same direction. Periods don't represent the end of a line. If a sentence spans multiple lines, the <code>DetectText</code> operation returns multiple lines.</p> <p>To determine whether a <code>TextDetection</code> element is a line of text or a word, use the <code>TextDetection</code> object <code>Type</code> field. </p> <p>To be detected, text must be within +/- 90 degrees orientation of the horizontal axis.</p> <p>For more information, see DetectText in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.</p>",
