  "service": "<p>Amazon Lex provides both build and runtime endpoints. Each endpoint provides a set of operations (API). Your conversational bot uses the runtime API to understand user utterances (user input text or voice). For example, suppose a user says \"I want pizza\", your bot sends this input to Amazon Lex using the runtime API. Amazon Lex recognizes that the user request is for the OrderPizza intent (one of the intents defined in the bot). Then Amazon Lex engages in user conversation on behalf of the bot to elicit required information (slot values, such as pizza size and crust type), and then performs fulfillment activity (that you configured when you created the bot). You use the build-time API to create and manage your Amazon Lex bot. For a list of build-time operations, see the build-time API, . </p>",

Consider the following example messages: </p> <ul> <li> <p> For a user input \"I would like a pizza,\" Amazon Lex might return a response with a message eliciting slot data (for example, <code>PizzaSize</code>): \"What size pizza would you like?\". </p> </li> <li> <p> After the user provides all of the pizza order information, Amazon Lex might return a response with a message to get user confirmation: \"Order the pizza?\". </p> </li> <li> <p> After the user replies \"Yes\" to the confirmation prompt, Amazon Lex might return a conclusion statement: \"Thank you, your cheese pizza has been ordered.\". </p> </li> </ul> <p> Not all Amazon Lex messages require a response from the user. For example, conclusion statements do not require a response. Some messages require only a yes or no response. In addition to the <code>message</code>, Amazon Lex provides additional context about the message in the response that you can use to enhance client behavior, such as displaying the appropriate client user interface.
