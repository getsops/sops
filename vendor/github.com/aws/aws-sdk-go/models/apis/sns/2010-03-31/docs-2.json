  "service": "<fullname>Amazon Simple Notification Service</fullname> <p>Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a web service that enables you to build distributed web-enabled applications. Applications can use Amazon SNS to easily push real-time notification messages to interested subscribers over multiple delivery protocols. For more information about this product see <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/sns/\">http://aws.amazon.com/sns</a>. For detailed information about Amazon SNS features and their associated API calls, see the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/\">Amazon SNS Developer Guide</a>. </p> <p>We also provide SDKs that enable you to access Amazon SNS from your preferred programming language. The SDKs contain functionality that automatically takes care of tasks such as: cryptographically signing your service requests, retrying requests, and handling error responses. For a list of available SDKs, go to <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/tools/\">Tools for Amazon Web Services</a>. </p>",

You cannot send SMS messages to a number that is opted out.</p> <p>To resume sending messages, you can opt in the number by using the <code>OptInPhoneNumber</code> action.</p>",
    "ConfirmSubscription": "<p>Verifies an endpoint owner's intent to receive messages by validating the token sent to the endpoint by an earlier <code>Subscribe</code> action. If the token is valid, the action creates a new subscription and returns its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). This call requires an AWS signature only when the <code>AuthenticateOnUnsubscribe</code> flag is set to \"true\".</p>",
    "CreatePlatformApplication": "<p>Creates a platform application object for one of the supported push notification services, such as APNS and GCM, to which devices and mobile apps may register. You must specify PlatformPrincipal and PlatformCredential attributes when using the <code>CreatePlatformApplication</code> action. The PlatformPrincipal is received from the notification service. For APNS/APNS_SANDBOX, PlatformPrincipal is \"SSL certificate\". For GCM, PlatformPrincipal is not applicable. For ADM, PlatformPrincipal is \"client id\". The PlatformCredential is also received from the notification service. For WNS, PlatformPrincipal is \"Package Security Identifier\". For MPNS, PlatformPrincipal is \"TLS certificate\". For Baidu, PlatformPrincipal is \"API key\".</p> <p>For APNS/APNS_SANDBOX, PlatformCredential is \"private key\". For GCM, PlatformCredential is \"API key\". For ADM, PlatformCredential is \"client secret\". For WNS, PlatformCredential is \"secret key\". For MPNS, PlatformCredential is \"private key\". For Baidu, PlatformCredential is \"secret key\". The PlatformApplicationArn that is returned when using <code>CreatePlatformApplication</code> is then used as an attribute for the <code>CreatePlatformEndpoint</code> action. For more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/SNSMobilePush.html\">Using Amazon SNS Mobile Push Notifications</a>.

    "CreatePlatformEndpoint": "<p>Creates an endpoint for a device and mobile app on one of the supported push notification services, such as GCM and APNS. <code>CreatePlatformEndpoint</code> requires the PlatformApplicationArn that is returned from <code>CreatePlatformApplication</code>. The EndpointArn that is returned when using <code>CreatePlatformEndpoint</code> can then be used by the <code>Publish</code> action to send a message to a mobile app or by the <code>Subscribe</code> action for subscription to a topic. The <code>CreatePlatformEndpoint</code> action is idempotent, so if the requester already owns an endpoint with the same device token and attributes, that endpoint's ARN is returned without creating a new endpoint. For more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/SNSMobilePush.html\">Using Amazon SNS Mobile Push Notifications</a>. </p> <p>When using <code>CreatePlatformEndpoint</code> with Baidu, two attributes must be provided: ChannelId and UserId.

For each SMS message that you send, Amazon SNS writes a log that includes the message price, the success or failure status, the reason for failure (if the message failed), the message dwell time, and other information.</p> <p> <code>DeliveryStatusSuccessSamplingRate</code> – The percentage of successful SMS deliveries for which Amazon SNS will write logs in CloudWatch Logs.

You can assign the following values:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>Promotional</code> – (Default) Noncritical messages, such as marketing messages. Amazon SNS optimizes the message delivery to incur the lowest cost.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Transactional</code> – Critical messages that support customer transactions, such as one-time passcodes for multi-factor authentication. Amazon SNS optimizes the message delivery to achieve the highest reliability.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <code>UsageReportS3Bucket</code> – The name of the Amazon S3 bucket to receive daily SMS usage reports from Amazon SNS. Each day, Amazon SNS will deliver a usage report as a CSV file to the bucket.
