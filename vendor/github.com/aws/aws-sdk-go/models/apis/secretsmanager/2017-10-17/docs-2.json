  "service": "<fullname>AWS Secrets Manager API Reference</fullname> <p>AWS Secrets Manager is a web service that enables you to store, manage, and retrieve, secrets.</p> <p>This guide provides descriptions of the Secrets Manager API. For more information about using this service, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/introduction.html\">AWS Secrets Manager User Guide</a>.</p> <p> <b>API Version</b> </p> <p>This version of the Secrets Manager API Reference documents the Secrets Manager API version 2017-10-17.</p> <note> <p>As an alternative to using the API directly, you can use one of the AWS SDKs, which consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (such as Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, and Android). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS Secrets Manager. For example, the SDKs take care of cryptographically signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/tools/\">Tools for Amazon Web Services</a>.</p> </note> <p>We recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to Secrets Manager. However, you also can use the Secrets Manager HTTP Query API to make direct calls to the Secrets Manager web service. To learn more about the Secrets Manager HTTP Query API, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/query-requests.html\">Making Query Requests</a> in the <i>AWS Secrets Manager User Guide</i>. </p> <p>Secrets Manager supports GET and POST requests for all actions. That is, the API doesn't require you to use GET for some actions and POST for others. However, GET requests are subject to the limitation size of a URL. Therefore, for operations that require larger sizes, use a POST request.</p> <p> <b>Support and Feedback for AWS Secrets Manager</b> </p> <p>We welcome your feedback. Send your comments to <a href=\"mailto:awssecretsmanager-feedback@amazon.com\">awssecretsmanager-feedback@amazon.com</a>, or post your feedback and questions in the <a href=\"http://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=296\">AWS Secrets Manager Discussion Forum</a>. For more information about the AWS Discussion Forums, see <a href=\"http://forums.aws.amazon.com/help.jspa\">Forums Help</a>.</p> <p> <b>How examples are presented</b> </p> <p>The JSON that AWS Secrets Manager expects as your request parameters and that the service returns as a response to HTTP query requests are single, long strings without line breaks or white space formatting. The JSON shown in the examples is formatted with both line breaks and white space to improve readability. When example input parameters would also result in long strings that extend beyond the screen, we insert line breaks to enhance readability. You should always submit the input as a single JSON text string.</p> <p> <b>Logging API Requests</b> </p> <p>AWS Secrets Manager supports AWS CloudTrail, a service that records AWS API calls for your AWS account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using information that's collected by AWS CloudTrail, you can determine which requests were successfully made to Secrets Manager, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. For more about AWS Secrets Manager and its support for AWS CloudTrail, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/monitoring.html#monitoring_cloudtrail\">Logging AWS Secrets Manager Events with AWS CloudTrail</a> in the <i>AWS Secrets Manager User Guide</i>. To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/what_is_cloud_trail_top_level.html\">AWS CloudTrail User Guide</a>.</p>",

This will immediately rotate your secret and then enable the automatic schedule.</p> <note> <p>If you cancel a rotation that is in progress, it can leave the <code>VersionStage</code> labels in an unexpected state. Depending on what step of the rotation was in progress, you might need to remove the staging label <code>AWSPENDING</code> from the partially created version, specified by the <code>VersionId</code> response value. You should also evaluate the partially rotated new version to see if it should be deleted, which you can do by removing all staging labels from the new version's <code>VersionStage</code> field.</p> </note> <p>To successfully start a rotation, the staging label <code>AWSPENDING</code> must be in one of the following states:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Not be attached to any version at all</p> </li> <li> <p>Attached to the same version as the staging label <code>AWSCURRENT</code> </p> </li> </ul> <p>If the staging label <code>AWSPENDING</code> is attached to a different version than the version with <code>AWSCURRENT</code> then the attempt to rotate fails.</p> <p> <b>Minimum permissions</b> </p> <p>To run this command, you must have the following permissions:</p> <ul> <li> <p>secretsmanager:CancelRotateSecret</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Related operations</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p>To configure rotation for a secret or to manually trigger a rotation, use <a>RotateSecret</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>To get the rotation configuration details for a secret, use <a>DescribeSecret</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>To list all of the currently available secrets, use <a>ListSecrets</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>To list all of the versions currently associated with a secret, use <a>ListSecretVersionIds</a>.</p> </li> </ul>",
    "CreateSecret": "<p>Creates a new secret. A secret in Secrets Manager consists of both the protected secret data and the important information needed to manage the secret.</p> <p>Secrets Manager stores the encrypted secret data in one of a collection of \"versions\" associated with the secret. Each version contains a copy of the encrypted secret data. Each version is associated with one or more \"staging labels\" that identify where the version is in the rotation cycle. The <code>SecretVersionsToStages</code> field of the secret contains the mapping of staging labels to the active versions of the secret. Versions without a staging label are considered deprecated and are not included in the list.</p> <p>You provide the secret data to be encrypted by putting text in either the <code>SecretString</code> parameter or binary data in the <code>SecretBinary</code> parameter, but not both. If you include <code>SecretString</code> or <code>SecretBinary</code> then Secrets Manager also creates an initial secret version and automatically attaches the staging label <code>AWSCURRENT</code> to the new version.</p> <note> <ul> <li> <p>If you call an operation that needs to encrypt or decrypt the <code>SecretString</code> or <code>SecretBinary</code> for a secret in the same account as the calling user and that secret doesn't specify a AWS KMS encryption key, Secrets Manager uses the account's default AWS managed customer master key (CMK) with the alias <code>aws/secretsmanager</code>. If this key doesn't already exist in your account then Secrets Manager creates it for you automatically. All users and roles in the same AWS account automatically have access to use the default CMK. Note that if an Secrets Manager API call results in AWS having to create the account's AWS-managed CMK, it can result in a one-time significant delay in returning the result.</p> </li> <li> <p>If the secret is in a different AWS account from the credentials calling an API that requires encryption or decryption of the secret value then you must create and use a custom AWS KMS CMK because you can't access the default CMK for the account using credentials from a different AWS account. Store the ARN of the CMK in the secret when you create the secret or when you update it by including it in the <code>KMSKeyId</code>. If you call an API that must encrypt or decrypt <code>SecretString</code> or <code>SecretBinary</code> using credentials from a different account then the AWS KMS key policy must grant cross-account access to that other account's user or role for both the kms:GenerateDataKey and kms:Decrypt operations.</p> </li> </ul> </note> <p> </p> <p> <b>Minimum permissions</b> </p> <p>To run this command, you must have the following permissions:</p> <ul> <li> <p>secretsmanager:CreateSecret</p> </li> <li> <p>kms:GenerateDataKey - needed only if you use a customer-managed AWS KMS key to encrypt the secret.
