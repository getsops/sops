  "service": "<fullname>Amazon Elastic File System</fullname> <p>Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides simple, scalable file storage for use with Amazon EC2 instances in the AWS Cloud. With Amazon EFS, storage capacity is elastic, growing and shrinking automatically as you add and remove files, so your applications have the storage they need, when they need it. For more information, see the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/api-reference.html\">User Guide</a>.</p>",
  "operations": {
    "CreateFileSystem": "<p>Creates a new, empty file system. The operation requires a creation token in the request that Amazon EFS uses to ensure idempotent creation (calling the operation with same creation token has no effect). If a file system does not currently exist that is owned by the caller's AWS account with the specified creation token, this operation does the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Creates a new, empty file system. The file system will have an Amazon EFS assigned ID, and an initial lifecycle state <code>creating</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Returns with the description of the created file system.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Otherwise, this operation returns a <code>FileSystemAlreadyExists</code> error with the ID of the existing file system.</p> <note> <p>For basic use cases, you can use a randomly generated UUID for the creation token.</p> </note> <p> The idempotent operation allows you to retry a <code>CreateFileSystem</code> call without risk of creating an extra file system. This can happen when an initial call fails in a way that leaves it uncertain whether or not a file system was actually created. An example might be that a transport level timeout occurred or your connection was reset. As long as you use the same creation token, if the initial call had succeeded in creating a file system, the client can learn of its existence from the <code>FileSystemAlreadyExists</code> error.</p> <note> <p>The <code>CreateFileSystem</code> call returns while the file system's lifecycle state is still <code>creating</code>. You can check the file system creation status by calling the <a>DescribeFileSystems</a> operation, which among other things returns the file system state.</p> </note> <p>This operation also takes an optional <code>PerformanceMode</code> parameter that you choose for your file system. We recommend <code>generalPurpose</code> performance mode for most file systems. File systems using the <code>maxIO</code> performance mode can scale to higher levels of aggregate throughput and operations per second with a tradeoff of slightly higher latencies for most file operations. The performance mode can't be changed after the file system has been created. For more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/performance.html#performancemodes.html\">Amazon EFS: Performance Modes</a>.</p> <p>After the file system is fully created, Amazon EFS sets its lifecycle state to <code>available</code>, at which point you can create one or more mount targets for the file system in your VPC. For more information, see <a>CreateMountTarget</a>. You mount your Amazon EFS file system on an EC2 instances in your VPC via the mount target. For more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/how-it-works.html\">Amazon EFS: How it Works</a>. </p> <p> This operation requires permissions for the <code>elasticfilesystem:CreateFileSystem</code> action. </p>",
    "CreateMountTarget": "<p>Creates a mount target for a file system. You can then mount the file system on EC2 instances via the mount target.</p> <p>You can create one mount target in each Availability Zone in your VPC. All EC2 instances in a VPC within a given Availability Zone share a single mount target for a given file system. If you have multiple subnets in an Availability Zone, you create a mount target in one of the subnets. EC2 instances do not need to be in the same subnet as the mount target in order to access their file system. For more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/how-it-works.html\">Amazon EFS: How it Works</a>. </p> <p>In the request, you also specify a file system ID for which you are creating the mount target and the file system's lifecycle state must be <code>available</code>. For more information, see <a>DescribeFileSystems</a>.</p> <p>In the request, you also provide a subnet ID, which determines the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>VPC in which Amazon EFS creates the mount target</p> </li> <li> <p>Availability Zone in which Amazon EFS creates the mount target</p> </li> <li> <p>IP address range from which Amazon EFS selects the IP address of the mount target (if you don't specify an IP address in the request)</p> </li> </ul> <p>After creating the mount target, Amazon EFS returns a response that includes, a <code>MountTargetId</code> and an <code>IpAddress</code>. You use this IP address when mounting the file system in an EC2 instance. You can also use the mount target's DNS name when mounting the file system. The EC2 instance on which you mount the file system via the mount target can resolve the mount target's DNS name to its IP address. For more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/how-it-works.html#how-it-works-implementation\">How it Works: Implementation Overview</a>. </p> <p>Note that you can create mount targets for a file system in only one VPC, and there can be only one mount target per Availability Zone. That is, if the file system already has one or more mount targets created for it, the subnet specified in the request to add another mount target must meet the following requirements:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Must belong to the same VPC as the subnets of the existing mount targets</p> </li> <li> <p>Must not be in the same Availability Zone as any of the subnets of the existing mount targets</p> </li> </ul> <p>If the request satisfies the requirements, Amazon EFS does the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Creates a new mount target in the specified subnet.</p> </li> <li> <p>Also creates a new network interface in the subnet as follows:</p> <ul> <li> <p>If the request provides an <code>IpAddress</code>, Amazon EFS assigns that IP address to the network interface. Otherwise, Amazon EFS assigns a free address in the subnet (in the same way that the Amazon EC2 <code>CreateNetworkInterface</code> call does when a request does not specify a primary private IP address).</p> </li> <li> <p>If the request provides <code>SecurityGroups</code>, this network interface is associated with those security groups. Otherwise, it belongs to the default security group for the subnet's VPC.</p> </li> <li> <p>Assigns the description <code>Mount target <i>fsmt-id</i> for file system <i>fs-id</i> </code> where <code> <i>fsmt-id</i> </code> is the mount target ID, and <code> <i>fs-id</i> </code> is the <code>FileSystemId</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sets the <code>requesterManaged</code> property of the network interface to <code>true</code>, and the <code>requesterId</code> value to <code>EFS</code>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Each Amazon EFS mount target has one corresponding requester-managed EC2 network interface. After the network interface is created, Amazon EFS sets the <code>NetworkInterfaceId</code> field in the mount target's description to the network interface ID, and the <code>IpAddress</code> field to its address. If network interface creation fails, the entire <code>CreateMountTarget</code> operation fails.</p> </li> </ul> <note> <p>The <code>CreateMountTarget</code> call returns only after creating the network interface, but while the mount target state is still <code>creating</code>, you can check the mount target creation status by calling the <a>DescribeMountTargets</a> operation, which among other things returns the mount target state.</p> </note> <p>We recommend you create a mount target in each of the Availability Zones. There are cost considerations for using a file system in an Availability Zone through a mount target created in another Availability Zone. For more information, see <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/efs/\">Amazon EFS</a>. In addition, by always using a mount target local to the instance's Availability Zone, you eliminate a partial failure scenario. If the Availability Zone in which your mount target is created goes down, then you won't be able to access your file system through that mount target. </p> <p>This operation requires permissions for the following action on the file system:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>elasticfilesystem:CreateMountTarget</code> </p> </li> </ul> <p>This operation also requires permissions for the following Amazon EC2 actions:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>ec2:DescribeSubnets</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>ec2:CreateNetworkInterface</code> </p> </li> </ul>",

If you pass file system ID or creation token for the deleted file system, the <a>DescribeFileSystems</a> returns a <code>404 FileSystemNotFound</code> error.</p> </note> <p>This operation requires permissions for the <code>elasticfilesystem:DeleteFileSystem</code> action.</p>",
    "DeleteMountTarget": "<p>Deletes the specified mount target.</p> <p>This operation forcibly breaks any mounts of the file system via the mount target that is being deleted, which might disrupt instances or applications using those mounts. To avoid applications getting cut off abruptly, you might consider unmounting any mounts of the mount target, if feasible. The operation also deletes the associated network interface. Uncommitted writes may be lost, but breaking a mount target using this operation does not corrupt the file system itself. The file system you created remains.
