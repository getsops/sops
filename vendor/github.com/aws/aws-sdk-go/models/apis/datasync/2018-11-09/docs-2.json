    "CancelTaskExecution": "<p>Cancels execution of a task. </p> <p>When you cancel a task execution, the transfer of some files are abruptly interrupted. The contents of files that are transferred to the destination might be incomplete or inconsistent with the source files. However, if you start a new task execution on the same task and you allow the task execution to complete, file content on the destination is complete and consistent. This applies to other unexpected failures that interrupt a task execution. In all of these cases, AWS DataSync successfully complete the transfer when you start the next task execution. </p>",
    "CreateAgent": "<p>Activates an AWS DataSync agent that you have deployed on your host. The activation process associates your agent with your account. In the activation process, you specify information such as the AWS Region that you want to activate the agent in. You activate the agent in the AWS Region where your target locations (in Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS) reside. Your tasks are created in this AWS Region. </p> <p>You can use an agent for more than one location. If a task uses multiple agents, all of them need to have status AVAILABLE for the task to run. If you use multiple agents for a source location, the status of all the agents must be AVAILABLE for the task to run. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sync-service/latest/userguide/working-with-sync-agents.html#activating-sync-agent\">Activating a Sync Agent</a> in the <i>AWS DataSync User Guide.</i> </p> <p>Agents are automatically updated by AWS on a regular basis, using a mechanism that ensures minimal interruption to your tasks.</p> <p/>",

    "CreateLocationS3": "<p>Creates an endpoint for an Amazon S3 bucket.</p> <p>For AWS DataSync to access a destination S3 bucket, it needs an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that has the required permissions. You can set up the required permissions by creating an IAM policy that grants the required permissions and attaching the policy to the role. An example of such a policy is shown in the examples section.

    "CreateTask": "<p>Creates a task. A task is a set of two locations (source and destination) and a set of default <code>OverrideOptions</code> that you use to control the behavior of a task. If you don't specify default values for <code>Options</code> when you create a task, AWS DataSync populates them with safe service defaults.</p> <p>When you initially create a task, it enters the INITIALIZING status and then the CREATING status. In CREATING status, AWS DataSync attempts to mount the source Network File System (NFS) location. The task transitions to the AVAILABLE status without waiting for the destination location to mount. Instead, AWS DataSync mounts a destination before every task execution and then unmounts it after every task execution. </p> <p>If an agent that is associated with a source (NFS) location goes offline, the task transitions to the UNAVAILABLE status. If the status of the task remains in the CREATING status for more than a few minutes, it means that your agent might be having trouble mounting the source NFS file system. Check the task's <code>ErrorCode</code> and <code>ErrorDetail</code>. Mount issues are often caused by either a misconfigured firewall or a mistyped NFS server host name.</p>",
    "DeleteAgent": "<p>Deletes an agent. To specify which agent to delete, use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the agent in your request.
