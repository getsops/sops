  "service": "<p>Amazon EC2 Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast, container management service that makes it easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster of EC2 instances. Amazon ECS lets you launch and stop container-enabled applications with simple API calls, allows you to get the state of your cluster from a centralized service, and gives you access to many familiar Amazon EC2 features like security groups, Amazon EBS volumes, and IAM roles.</p> <p>You can use Amazon ECS to schedule the placement of containers across your cluster based on your resource needs, isolation policies, and availability requirements. Amazon EC2 Container Service eliminates the need for you to operate your own cluster management and configuration management systems or worry about scaling your management infrastructure.</p>",
  "operations": {
    "CreateCluster": "<p>Creates a new Amazon ECS cluster. By default, your account receives a <code>default</code> cluster when you launch your first container instance. However, you can create your own cluster with a unique name with the <code>CreateCluster</code> action.</p>",
    "CreateService": "<p>Runs and maintains a desired number of tasks from a specified task definition. If the number of tasks running in a service drops below <code>desiredCount</code>, Amazon ECS spawns another copy of the task in the specified cluster. To update an existing service, see <a>UpdateService</a>.</p> <p>In addition to maintaining the desired count of tasks in your service, you can optionally run your service behind a load balancer. The load balancer distributes traffic across the tasks that are associated with the service. For more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-load-balancing.html\">Service Load Balancing</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 Container Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>You can optionally specify a deployment configuration for your service. During a deployment (which is triggered by changing the task definition or the desired count of a service with an <a>UpdateService</a> operation), the service scheduler uses the <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> and <code>maximumPercent</code> parameters to determine the deployment strategy.</p> <p>The <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> represents a lower limit on the number of your service's tasks that must remain in the <code>RUNNING</code> state during a deployment, as a percentage of the <code>desiredCount</code> (rounded up to the nearest integer). This parameter enables you to deploy without using additional cluster capacity. For example, if your service has a <code>desiredCount</code> of four tasks and a <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> of 50%, the scheduler can stop two existing tasks to free up cluster capacity before starting two new tasks. Tasks for services that <i>do not</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the <code>RUNNING</code> state. Tasks for services that <i>do</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the <code>RUNNING</code> state and the container instance they are hosted on is reported as healthy by the load balancer. The default value for <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> is 50% in the console and 100% for the AWS CLI, the AWS SDKs, and the APIs.</p> <p>The <code>maximumPercent</code> parameter represents an upper limit on the number of your service's tasks that are allowed in the <code>RUNNING</code> or <code>PENDING</code> state during a deployment, as a percentage of the <code>desiredCount</code> (rounded down to the nearest integer). This parameter enables you to define the deployment batch size. For example, if your service has a <code>desiredCount</code> of four tasks and a <code>maximumPercent</code> value of 200%, the scheduler can start four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available). The default value for <code>maximumPercent</code> is 200%.</p> <p>When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it determines task placement in your cluster using the following logic:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Determine which of the container instances in your cluster can support your service's task definition (for example, they have the required CPU, memory, ports, and container instance attributes).</p> </li> <li> <p>By default, the service scheduler attempts to balance tasks across Availability Zones in this manner (although you can choose a different placement strategy) with the <code>placementStrategy</code> parameter):</p> <ul> <li> <p>Sort the valid container instances by the fewest number of running tasks for this service in the same Availability Zone as the instance. For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C each have zero, valid container instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal for placement.</p> </li> <li> <p>Place the new service task on a valid container instance in an optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container instances with the fewest number of running tasks for this service.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul>",

For more information, see <a>UpdateService</a>.</p> <note> <p>When you delete a service, if there are still running tasks that require cleanup, the service status moves from <code>ACTIVE</code> to <code>DRAINING</code>, and the service is no longer visible in the console or in <a>ListServices</a> API operations. After the tasks have stopped, then the service status moves from <code>DRAINING</code> to <code>INACTIVE</code>.

This parameter specifies the minimum amount of CPU to reserve for a container, and containers share unallocated CPU units with other containers on the instance with the same ratio as their allocated amount. This parameter maps to <code>CpuShares</code> in the <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/api/docker_remote_api_v1.23/#create-a-container\">Create a container</a> section of the <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/api/docker_remote_api_v1.23/\">Docker Remote API</a> and the <code>--cpu-shares</code> option to <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/\">docker run</a>.</p> <note> <p>You can determine the number of CPU units that are available per EC2 instance type by multiplying the vCPUs listed for that instance type on the <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/\">Amazon EC2 Instances</a> detail page by 1,024.</p> </note> <p>For example, if you run a single-container task on a single-core instance type with 512 CPU units specified for that container, and that is the only task running on the container instance, that container could use the full 1,024 CPU unit share at any given time. However, if you launched another copy of the same task on that container instance, each task would be guaranteed a minimum of 512 CPU units when needed, and each container could float to higher CPU usage if the other container was not using it, but if both tasks were 100% active all of the time, they would be limited to 512 CPU units.</p> <p>The Docker daemon on the container instance uses the CPU value to calculate the relative CPU share ratios for running containers. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#cpu-share-constraint\">CPU share constraint</a> in the Docker documentation. The minimum valid CPU share value that the Linux kernel allows is 2; however, the CPU parameter is not required, and you can use CPU values below 2 in your container definitions. For CPU values below 2 (including null), the behavior varies based on your Amazon ECS container agent version:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Agent versions less than or equal to 1.1.0:</b> Null and zero CPU values are passed to Docker as 0, which Docker then converts to 1,024 CPU shares.
