  "service": "<fullname>Amazon Elastic Container Service</fullname> <p>Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast, container management service that makes it easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster. You can host your cluster on a serverless infrastructure that is managed by Amazon ECS by launching your services or tasks using the Fargate launch type. For more control, you can host your tasks on a cluster of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances that you manage by using the EC2 launch type. For more information about launch types, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/launch_types.html\">Amazon ECS Launch Types</a>.</p> <p>Amazon ECS lets you launch and stop container-based applications with simple API calls, allows you to get the state of your cluster from a centralized service, and gives you access to many familiar Amazon EC2 features.</p> <p>You can use Amazon ECS to schedule the placement of containers across your cluster based on your resource needs, isolation policies, and availability requirements. Amazon ECS eliminates the need for you to operate your own cluster management and configuration management systems or worry about scaling your management infrastructure.</p>",
  "operations": {
    "CreateCluster": "<p>Creates a new Amazon ECS cluster. By default, your account receives a <code>default</code> cluster when you launch your first container instance. However, you can create your own cluster with a unique name with the <code>CreateCluster</code> action.</p> <note> <p>When you call the <a>CreateCluster</a> API operation, Amazon ECS attempts to create the service-linked role for your account so that required resources in other AWS services can be managed on your behalf. However, if the IAM user that makes the call does not have permissions to create the service-linked role, it is not created. For more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/using-service-linked-roles.html\">Using Service-Linked Roles for Amazon ECS</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> </note>",
    "CreateService": "<p>Runs and maintains a desired number of tasks from a specified task definition. If the number of tasks running in a service drops below the <code>desiredCount</code>, Amazon ECS spawns another copy of the task in the specified cluster. To update an existing service, see <a>UpdateService</a>.</p> <p>In addition to maintaining the desired count of tasks in your service, you can optionally run your service behind a load balancer. The load balancer distributes traffic across the tasks that are associated with the service. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-load-balancing.html\">Service Load Balancing</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>Tasks for services that <i>do not</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the <code>RUNNING</code> state. Tasks for services that <i>do</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the <code>RUNNING</code> state and the container instance that they're hosted on is reported as healthy by the load balancer.</p> <p>There are two service scheduler strategies available:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>REPLICA</code> - The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains the desired number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the service scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task placement strategies and constraints to customize task placement decisions. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html\">Service Scheduler Concepts</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>DAEMON</code> - The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on each active container instance that meets all of the task placement constraints that you specify in your cluster. When using this strategy, you don't need to specify a desired number of tasks, a task placement strategy, or use Service Auto Scaling policies. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html\">Service Scheduler Concepts</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>You can optionally specify a deployment configuration for your service. The deployment is triggered by changing properties, such as the task definition or the desired count of a service, with an <a>UpdateService</a> operation. The default value for a replica service for <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> is 100%. The default value for a daemon service for <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> is 0%.</p> <p>If a service is using the <code>ECS</code> deployment controller, the minimum healthy percent represents a lower limit on the number of tasks in a service that must remain in the <code>RUNNING</code> state during a deployment, as a percentage of the desired number of tasks (rounded up to the nearest integer), and while any container instances are in the <code>DRAINING</code> state if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. This parameter enables you to deploy without using additional cluster capacity. For example, if your service has a desired number of four tasks and a minimum healthy percent of 50%, the scheduler might stop two existing tasks to free up cluster capacity before starting two new tasks. Tasks for services that <i>do not</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the <code>RUNNING</code> state. Tasks for services that <i>do</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the <code>RUNNING</code> state and they're reported as healthy by the load balancer. The default value for minimum healthy percent is 100%.</p> <p>If a service is using the <code>ECS</code> deployment controller, the <b>maximum percent</b> parameter represents an upper limit on the number of tasks in a service that are allowed in the <code>RUNNING</code> or <code>PENDING</code> state during a deployment, as a percentage of the desired number of tasks (rounded down to the nearest integer), and while any container instances are in the <code>DRAINING</code> state if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. This parameter enables you to define the deployment batch size. For example, if your service has a desired number of four tasks and a maximum percent value of 200%, the scheduler may start four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available). The default value for maximum percent is 200%.</p> <p>If a service is using either the <code>CODE_DEPLOY</code> or <code>EXTERNAL</code> deployment controller types and tasks that use the EC2 launch type, the <b>minimum healthy percent</b> and <b>maximum percent</b> values are used only to define the lower and upper limit on the number of the tasks in the service that remain in the <code>RUNNING</code> state while the container instances are in the <code>DRAINING</code> state. If the tasks in the service use the Fargate launch type, the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent values aren't used, although they're currently visible when describing your service.</p> <p>When creating a service that uses the <code>EXTERNAL</code> deployment controller, you can specify only parameters that aren't controlled at the task set level. The only required parameter is the service name. You control your services using the <a>CreateTaskSet</a> operation.

If you are finished using the instance, be sure to terminate it in the Amazon EC2 console to stop billing.</p> <note> <p>If you terminate a running container instance, Amazon ECS automatically deregisters the instance from your cluster (stopped container instances or instances with disconnected agents are not automatically deregistered when terminated).</p> </note>",
