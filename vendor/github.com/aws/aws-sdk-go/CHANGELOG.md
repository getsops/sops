The second rule is for alarms based on percentiles metrics that can trigger unnecassarily if the percentile is calculated from a small number of samples. The new rule can treat percentiles with low sample counts as same as missing data. If the first rule is enabled, the same treatment will be applied when an alarm encounters a percentile with low sample counts.

Once a file share is created, any changes made externally to the S3 bucket will not be reflected by the gateway. Using the cache refresh feature in this update, the customer can trigger an on-demand scan of the keys in their S3 bucket and refresh the file namespace cached on the gateway. It takes as an input the fileShare ARN and refreshes the cache for only that file share. Additionally there is new functionality on file gateway that allows you configure what squash options they would like on their file share, this allows a customer to configure their gateway to not squash root permissions. This can be done by setting options in NfsOptions for CreateNfsFileShare and UpdateNfsFileShare APIs.

### Service Client Updates
* `service/batch`: Updates service API, documentation, and paginators

* `service/ec2`: Updates service API and documentation
	* Customers can now tag their Amazon EC2 Instances and Amazon EBS Volumes at
	the time of their creation. You can do this from the EC2 Instance launch
	wizard or through the RunInstances or CreateVolume APIs. By tagging
	resources at the time of creation, you can eliminate the need to run custom
	tagging scripts after resource creation. In addition, you can now set
	resource-level permissions on the CreateVolume, CreateTags, DeleteTags, and
	the RunInstances APIs. This allows you to implement stronger security
	policies by giving you more granular control over which users and groups
	have access to these APIs. You can also enforce the use of tagging and
	control what tag keys and values are set on your resources. When you combine
	tag usage and resource-level IAM policies together, you can ensure your
	instances and volumes are properly secured upon creation and achieve more
	accurate cost allocation reporting. These new features are provided at no
	additional cost.
