      Demote this {{replicationDisplayMode}} primary cluster to a {{replicationDisplayMode}} secondary. The resulting secondary cluster will not
      attempt to connect to a primary, but will maintain knowledge of its cluster
      ID and can be reconnected to the same set of replication clusters without
      wiping local storage.

      In order to connect the resulting secondary to a new primary, use the <code>Update primary</code> action.
