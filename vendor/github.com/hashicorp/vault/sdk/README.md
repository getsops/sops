Vault SDK libs
=================

This package provides the `sdk` package which contains code useful for
developing Vault plugins.

Although we try not to break functionality, we reserve the right to reorganize
the code at will and may occasionally cause breaks if they are warranted. As
such we expect the tag of this module will stay less than `v1.0.0`.

For any major changes we will try to give advance notice in the CHANGES section
of Vault's CHANGELOG.md.
