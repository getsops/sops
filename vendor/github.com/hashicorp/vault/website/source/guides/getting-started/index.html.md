# Vault Getting Started

Welcome to the Vault guides section! If you are just getting started with Vault,
please start with the [Vault introduction](/intro/getting-started/install.html)
instead and then continue on to the guides. The guides provide examples of
common Vault workflows and actions for both beginner and advanced Vault users.
