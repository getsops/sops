# Google Cloud KMS Secrets Engine (API)

This is the API documentation for the Vault Google Cloud KMS secrets engine. For
general information about the usage and operation of the Google Cloud KMS
secrets engine, please see the
[Google Cloud KMS documentation](/docs/secrets/gcpkms/index.html).

This documentation assumes the Google Cloud KMS secrets engine is enabled at the
`/gcpkms` path in Vault. Since it is possible to enable secrets engines at any
location, please update your API calls accordingly.

## Configure Credentials

This endpoint configures the Google Cloud KMS secrets engine with credentials
and manages the requested scope(s) for authentication.

| Method   | Path                     |
| :------------------------| :------------------------ |
| `POST`   | `gcpkms/config`          |

### Example Policy

```hcl
path "gcpkms/config" {
  capabilities = ["create", "update"]
}
```

### Parameters

- `credentials` (`string: ""`) -
The credentials to use for authenticating to Google Cloud. Leave this blank to
use the Default Application Credentials or instance metadata authentication.

- `scopes` (`array<string>: []`) -
The list of full-URL scopes to request when authenticating. By default, this
requests https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloudkms.

### Sample Payload

## Decrypt Ciphertext

This endpoint uses the named encryption key to decrypt the ciphertext string. For symmetric key types, the provided ciphertext must come from a previous invocation of the `/encrypt` endpoint. For asymmetric key types, the provided ciphertext must be from the encrypt operation against the corresponding key version's public key.

| Method   | Path                       |
| :--------------------------| :------------------------ |
| `POST`   | `gcpkms/decrypt/:key`      |

### Example Policy

```hcl
path "gcpkms/decrypt/my-key" {
  capabilities = ["create", "update"]
}
```

### Parameters

- `key` (`string: ""`) -
Name of the key in Vault to use for decryption. This key must already exist in
Vault and must map back to a Google Cloud KMS key.
This is specified as part of the URL.

- `additional_authenticated_data` (`string: ""`) -
Optional data that was specified during encryption of this payload.

- `ciphertext` (`string: ""`) -
Ciphertext to decrypt as previously returned from an encrypt operation. This
must be base64-encoded ciphertext as previously returned from an encrypt
operation.

- `key_version` (`int: 0`) -
Integer version of the crypto key version to use for decryption. This is
required for asymmetric keys. For symmetric keys, Cloud KMS will choose the
correct version automatically.

### Sample Payload

```json
{
  "ciphertext": "CiQAuMv0..."
}
```

### Sample Request

```text
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    --request POST \
    --data @payload.json \
    https://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/gcpkms/decrypt/my-key
```

### Sample Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "plaintext": "hello world"
  }
}
```

## Encrypt Plaintext

This endpoint uses the named encryption key to encrypt arbitrary plaintext
string data. The response will be base64-encoded encrypted ciphertext.

| Method   | Path                       |
| :--------------------------| :------------------------ |
| `POST`   | `gcpkms/encrypt/:key`      |

### Example Policy

```hcl
path "gcpkms/encrypt/my-key" {
  capabilities = ["create", "update"]
}
```

### Parameters

- `key` (`string: ""`) -
Name of the key in Vault to use for encryption. This key must already exist in
Vault and must map back to a Google Cloud KMS key.
This is specified as part of the URL.

- `additional_authenticated_data` (`string: ""`) -
Optional base64-encoded data that, if specified, must also be provided to
decrypt this payload.

- `key_version` (`int: 0`) -
Integer version of the crypto key version to use for encryption. If unspecified,
this defaults to the latest active crypto key version.

- `plaintext` (`string: ""`) -
Plaintext value to be encrypted. This can be a string or binary, but the size
is limited. See the Google Cloud KMS documentation for information on size
limitations by key types.

### Sample Payload

```json
{
  "plaintext": "hello world"
}
```

### Sample Request

```text
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \

```

### Sample Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "ciphertext": "CiQAuMv0...",
    "key_version": "1"
  }
}
```

## Re-Encrypt Existing Ciphertext

This endpoint uses the named encryption key to re-encrypt the underlying
cryptokey to the latest version for this ciphertext without disclosing the
original plaintext value to the requestor. This is similar to "rewrapping" in
Vault's transit secrets engine.

| Method   | Path                       |
| :--------------------------| :------------------------ |
| `POST`   | `gcpkms/reencrypt/:key`    |

Name of the key to use for encryption. This key must already exist in Vault and
Google Cloud KMS.
This is specified as part of the URL.

- `additional_authenticated_data` (`string: ""`) -
Optional data that, if specified, must also be provided during decryption.

- `ciphertext` (`string: ""`) -
Ciphertext to be re-encrypted to the latest key version. This must be ciphertext
that Vault previously generated for this named key.

- `key_version` (`int: 0`) -
Integer version of the crypto key version to use for re-encryption. If unspecified,
this defaults to the latest active crypto key version.

### Sample Payload
