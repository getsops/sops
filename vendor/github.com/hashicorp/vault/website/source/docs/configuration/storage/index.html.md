# `storage` Stanza

The `storage` stanza configures the storage backend, which represents the
location for the durable storage of Vault's information. Each backend has pros,
cons, advantages, and trade-offs. For example, some backends support high
availability while others provide a more robust backup and restoration process.
For information about a specific backend, choose one from the navigation on the
left.

## Configuration

Storage backend configuration is done through the Vault configuration file using
the `storage` stanza:

```hcl
storage [NAME] {
  [PARAMETERS...]
}
```

For example:

```hcl
storage "file" {
  path = "/mnt/vault/data"
}
```

For configuration options which also read an environment variable, the
environment variable will take precedence over values in the configuration
file.
