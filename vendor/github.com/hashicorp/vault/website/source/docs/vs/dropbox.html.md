# Vault vs. Dropbox

It is an unfortunate truth that many organizations, big and small, often use Dropbox as a mechanism for storing secrets. It is so common that we've decided to make a special section for it instead of throwing it under the "custom solutions" header.

Dropbox is not made for storing secrets. Even if you're using something such as an encrypted disk image within Dropbox, it is subpar versus a real secret storage server.

A real secret management tool such as Vault has a stronger security model, integrates with many different authentication services, stores audit logs, can generate dynamic secrets, and more.

And, due to `vault` CLI, using `vault` on a developer machine is simple!
