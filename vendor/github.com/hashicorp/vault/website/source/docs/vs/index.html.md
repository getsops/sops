# Vault vs. Other Software

There are a number of other options in the market currently that claim
to store secrets in some capacity. This section compares Vault to these
other software choices.

Due to the bias of the comparisons being on the Vault website, we attempt
to only use facts. If you find something that is invalid or out of date
in the comparisons, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/issues) and we'll
address it as soon as possible.

Use the navigation on the left to read comparisons of Vault versus other
systems.
