# AppRole Auth Method

The `approle` auth method allows machines or _apps_ to authenticate with
Vault-defined _roles_. The open design of `AppRole` enables a varied set of
workflows and configurations to handle large numbers of apps. This auth method
is oriented to automated workflows (machines and services), and is less useful
for human operators.

An "AppRole" represents a set of Vault policies and login constraints that must
be met to receive a token with those policies. The scope can be as narrow or
broad as desired. An AppRole can be created for a particular machine, or even
a particular user on that machine, or a service spread across machines. The
credentials required for successful login depend upon the constraints set on
the AppRole associated with the credentials.

## Authentication

### Via the CLI

The default path is `/approle`. If this auth method was enabled at a different
path, specify `auth/my-path/login` instead.

```text
$ vault write auth/approle/login \
    role_id=db02de05-fa39-4855-059b-67221c5c2f63 \
    secret_id=6a174c20-f6de-a53c-74d2-6018fcceff64

Key                Value
---                -----
token              65b74ffd-842c-fd43-1386-f7d7006e520a
token_accessor     3c29bc22-5c72-11a6-f778-2bc8f48cea0e
token_duration     20m0s
token_renewable    true
token_policies     [default]
```

### Via the API

The default endpoint is `auth/approle/login`. If this auth method was enabled
at a different path, use that value instead of `approle`.

```sh
$ curl \
    --request POST \
    --data '{"role_id":"988a9df-...","secret_id":"37b74931..."}' \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/auth/approle/login
```

The response will contain the token at `auth.client_token`:

```json
{
  "auth": {
    "renewable": true,
    "lease_duration": 2764800,
    "metadata": {},
    "policies": [
      "default",
      "dev-policy",
      "test-policy"
    ],
    "accessor": "5d7fb475-07cb-4060-c2de-1ca3fcbf0c56",
    "client_token": "98a4c7ab-b1fe-361b-ba0b-e307aacfd587"
  }
}
```

## Configuration

Auth methods must be configured in advance before users or machines can
authenticate. These steps are usually completed by an operator or configuration
management tool.

### Via the CLI

1. Enable the AppRole auth method:

    ```text
    $ vault auth enable approle
    ```

1. Create a named role:

    ```text
    $ vault write auth/approle/role/my-role \
        secret_id_ttl=10m \
        token_num_uses=10 \
        token_ttl=20m \
        token_max_ttl=30m \
        secret_id_num_uses=40
    ```

    For the complete list of configuration options, please see the API
    documentation.

1. Fetch the RoleID of the AppRole:

    ```text
    $ vault read auth/approle/role/my-role/role-id
    role_id     db02de05-fa39-4855-059b-67221c5c2f63
    ```

1. Get a SecretID issued against the AppRole:

    ```text
    $ vault write -f auth/approle/role/my-role/secret-id
    secret_id               6a174c20-f6de-a53c-74d2-6018fcceff64
    secret_id_accessor      c454f7e5-996e-7230-6074-6ef26b7bcf86
    ```

### Via the API

1. Enable the AppRole auth method:

    ```sh
    $ curl \
        --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
        --request POST \
        --data '{"type": "approle"}' \
        http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/auth/approle
    ```

1. Create an AppRole with desired set of policies:

    ```sh
    $ curl \
        --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
        --request POST \
        --data '{"policies": "dev-policy,test-policy"}' \
        http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/auth/approle/role/my-role
    ```

1. Fetch the identifier of the role:

    ```sh
    $ curl \
        --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
        http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/auth/approle/role/my-role/role-id
    ```

    The response will look like:

    ```json
    {
      "data": {
        "role_id": "988a9dfd-ea69-4a53-6cb6-9d6b86474bba"
      }
    }
    ```

1. Create a new secret identifier under the role:

    ```sh
    $ curl \
        --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
        --request POST \
         http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/auth/approle/role/my-role/secret-id
    ```

    The response will look like:

    ```json
    {
      "data": {
        "secret_id_accessor": "45946873-1d96-a9d4-678c-9229f74386a5",
        "secret_id": "37b74931-c4cd-d49a-9246-ccc62d682a25"
      }
    }
    ```

## Credentials/Constraints

### RoleID

RoleID is an identifier that selects the AppRole against which the other
credentials are evaluated. When authenticating against this auth method's login
endpoint, the RoleID is a required argument (via `role_id`) at all times. By
default, RoleIDs are unique UUIDs, which allow them to serve as secondary
secrets to the other credential information. However, they can be set to
particular values to match introspected information by the client (for
instance, the client's domain name).

### SecretID

SecretID is a credential that is required by default for any login (via
`secret_id`) and is intended to always be secret. (For advanced usage,
requiring a SecretID can be disabled via an AppRole's `bind_secret_id`
parameter, allowing machines with only knowledge of the RoleID, or matching
other set constraints, to fetch a token). SecretIDs can be created against an
AppRole either via generation of a 128-bit purely random UUID by the role
itself (`Pull` mode) or via specific, custom values (`Push` mode). Similarly to
tokens, SecretIDs have properties like usage-limit, TTLs and expirations.

#### Pull And Push SecretID Modes

If the SecretID used for login is fetched from an AppRole, this is operating in
Pull mode. If a "custom" SecretID is set against an AppRole by the client, it
is referred to as a Push mode. Push mode mimics the behavior of the deprecated
App-ID auth method; however, in most cases Pull mode is the better approach. The
reason is that Push mode requires some other system to have knowledge of the
full set of client credentials (RoleID and SecretID) in order to create the
entry, even if these are then distributed via different paths. However, in Pull
mode, even though the RoleID must be known in order to distribute it to the
client, the SecretID can be kept confidential from all parties except for the
final authenticating client by using [Response
Wrapping](/docs/concepts/response-wrapping.html).

Push mode is available for App-ID workflow compatibility, which in some
specific cases is preferable, but in most cases Pull mode is more secure and
should be preferred.

### Further Constraints

`role_id` is a required credential at the login endpoint. AppRole pointed to by
the `role_id` will have constraints set on it. This dictates other `required`
credentials for login. The `bind_secret_id` constraint requires `secret_id` to
be presented at the login endpoint.  Going forward, this auth method can support
more constraint parameters to support varied set of Apps. Some constraints will
not require a credential, but still enforce constraints for login.  For
example, `secret_id_bound_cidrs` will only allow logins coming from IP addresses
belonging to configured CIDR blocks on the AppRole.

The AppRole auth method has a full HTTP API. Please see the
