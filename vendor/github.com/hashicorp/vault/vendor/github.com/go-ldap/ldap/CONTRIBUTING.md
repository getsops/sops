# Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contribution and improvements.

## Guiding Principles

To begin with here is a draft from an email exchange:

 * take compatibility seriously (our semvers, compatibility with older go versions, etc)
 * don't tag untested code for release
 * beware of baking in implicit behavior based on other libraries/tools choices
 * be as high-fidelity as possible in plumbing through LDAP data (don't mask errors or reduce power of someone using the library)
