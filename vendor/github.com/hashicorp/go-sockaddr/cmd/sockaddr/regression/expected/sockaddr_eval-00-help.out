Usage: sockaddr eval [options] [template ...]

  Parse the sockaddr template and evaluates the output.
  
  The `sockaddr` library has the potential to be very complex,
  which is why the `sockaddr` command supports an `eval`
  subcommand in order to test configurations from the command
  line.  The `eval` subcommand automatically wraps its input
  with the `{{` and `}}` template delimiters unless the `-r`
  command is specified, in which case `eval` parses the raw
  input.  If the `template` argument passed to `eval` is a
  dash (`-`), then `sockaddr eval` will read from stdin and
  automatically sets the `-r` flag.

Options:

  -d  Debug output
  -n  Suppress newlines between args
  -r  Suppress wrapping the input with {{ }} delimiters
